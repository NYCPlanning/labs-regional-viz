  <p class="lead">The <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/planning"> NYC Department of City Planning</a> <b> Metro Region Explorer </b> is an interactive map showing population, housing, and employment trends within the tri-state New York City metropolitan region and shares key insights about how the region has changed in the post-recession period and from 2000 to today. However, it is important to note that some of these data predate the ongoing impact of Covid-19.</p>

  Developed in collaboration between <a href="https://planninglabs.nyc/">DCP Planning Labs</a> and <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/planning-level/region/region.page">DCP Regional Planning</a>, this tool will be maintained as part of our ongoing commitment to help the public access and understand information about planning issues affecting NYC and the metro region. Please visit <a href="https://nyc.gov/region">nyc.gov/region</a> for additional tools and more information about the NYC Metro.

  ## Methodology and Definitions
  Metro Region Explorer is built using publicly available Federal datasets that have been processed and/or analyzed by DCP. Federal data are used to maintain reporting consistency over time and across state boundaries. Population, housing, and economic datasets are released with varying publication frequency, geographic coverage and detail, as described below. When examining change over time, Metro Region Explorer focuses on two time periods: post-Great Recession to today and 2000 to today. The post-Great Recession period start year depends on the data product, but generally starts in 2010. However, these data do not capture the ongoing impacts of Covid-19 on the region's labor force and commuting patterns. Direct links to Federal sites can be in the [Data Sources](#data-sources) section.

  ### Geographies and Boundaries

  Information is provided for geographic entities at four scales (from largest to smallest): region, subregion, county, and municipality. U.S. Census Tract geographic entities are used to enhance geographic accuracy for select data visualizations, however, data are not reported at this level due to reliability concerns [(more on data reliability)](#data-reliability).

  ##### Region
  The tri-state NYC metro _region_ geography represents New York City and 26 surrounding counties in portions of New York, north New Jersey and southwest Connecticut. This definition of the region is a generally accepted modification of the U.S. Census Bureau combined statistical area (CSA) for New York-Newark-Bridgeport and roughly represents the NYC commuter shed. This area does not represent a regulatory or other jurisdictional boundary. The region geography is not visualized as a single entity in Metro Region Explorer, but data are reported for all characteristics in the tool and the shapefile is available for download.

  ##### Subregion
  The _subregion_ geography represents aggregations of U.S. counties, which are commonly used for transportation planning and other regional analyses. Counties are grouped as follows:
    - _New York City_: Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), New York (Manhattan), Queens, and Richmond (Staten Island)
    - _Inner New Jersey_: Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, and Union
    - _Outer New Jersey_: Hunterdon, Mercer, Monmouth, Ocean, Sussex, and Warren
    - _Long Island_: Nassau and Suffolk
    - _Connecticut_: Fairfield, Litchfield, and New Haven
    - _Lower Hudson Valley_: Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester
    - _Mid Hudson Valley_: Dutchess, Orange, Sullivan, and Ulster

  Please note that “Inner” and “Outer” New Jersey suggest NYC proximity and/or accessibility and do not indicate formalized geographic locations or jurisdictional boundaries.

  ##### County
  The _county_ geography is represented by the region’s 31 counties, including the five boroughs/counties of NYC and surrounding 26 counties listed above.

  ##### Municipality
  The _municipality_ geography represents approximations for cities, towns, and villages within the NYC metropolitan region. The boundaries represent U.S. Census Bureau Minor County Division (MCD) geographies for all counties in New Jersey, Connecticut, and the Hudson Valley; U.S. Census Bureau Places (Places) boundaries for Long Island, unless otherwise noted; and, to represent NYC at municipality-comparable scale, DCP used the sub-borough geographies defined in the 2013 edition of [The Newest New Yorkers](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/newest-new-yorkers-2013.page) report, “Chapter 3: Settlement Patterns”. NYC geographies represent aggregations of U.S. Census Bureau Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). It is important to note that “municipalities” represented in this tool do not imply or consistently represent jurisdictional boundaries or governance authority. The purpose of this geography is to enable consistent longitudinal socioeconomic analysis across the region at comparable scale. When changes were detected within the study period (e.g., consolidation, renaming), data were recoded and thus may not reflect the 2020 geographic boundary to ensure analytic consistency over time. It is possible that inaccuracies in the data reflect additional changes to municipal borders or Census-defined geographic entities over this period. Municipality data are not visualized for select maps due to availability limitations or reliability concerns [(more about data reliability)](#data-reliability).

  ##### Rail Lines
  Rail lines, which can be toggled on by the user, represent the commuter rail network and stations (dark brown) and the NYC subway system and stations (dark grey) operated by NYC Transit. The commuter rail network includes lines operated by MTA Long Island Rail Road, MTA Metro-North Railroad, NJ Transit, PATH, and Amtrak.

  ### People

  ##### Population and Population Density
  U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates Program 2021 Vintage data are used for 2021 (county-level and above), and 2020 Redistricting Data are used for the municipality level. Population densities are calculated using land areas provided by the U.S. Census Bureau MAF/TIGER database as of 2021. Select municipal geographies were consolidated for longitudinal consistency (including Palm Tree, NY and Monroe, NY, East Setuaket and Setauket, NY, and Captree-Oak Beach-Gilgo Beach NY).

  ##### Population Change
  Population change from 2010 to 2021 is calculated using the 2010 Decennial Census and Population Estimates Program 2021 Vintage. On the municipality level, 2020 Redistricting Data are used. Select municipality geographies have been modified for longitudinal consistency as noted above.

  ##### Percent Foreign-born
  Percent foreign-born is calculated as the total population born outside of the United States over the total population estimate using the 2016-2020 ACS 5-Year Estimates for all geographies.

  ##### Race/Hispanic Origin
  Race and Hispanic origin are asked as two separate questions on the Census form. Data from these questions are used to create mutually exclusive race/Hispanic origin categories. Those who report Hispanic origin are included in the “Hispanic” population, regardless of race reported. (DCP acknowledges that there are other terms (e.g., Latinx) people of Latin American origin or descent use to self-identify. DCP uses “Hispanic” to maintain consistency with data provided and terminology used by the U.S. Census Bureau.) For all non-Hispanic groups, each category includes those who report one race alone, except for “two or more races,” which includes those reporting more than once race. Race and Hispanic origin categories are set by the federal government to inform enforcement of civil rights and equal employment opportunity laws, in addition to other anti-discrimination mandates. It is important to note that there is significant diversity within each of the broad race and Hispanic origin categories reported by the Census Bureau. It is important to note that the Census Bureau has cautioned comparisons between 2010 and 2020 and expects that the declining share of the White non-Hispanic population may be related to adjustments in the survey questions used for self-identification and subsequently how the results were processed [(please refer to the Census Bureau’s website for more information)](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html). Data are visualized as dot density by Census Tract, however, DCP recommends referring to municipality and larger geographies for the purpose data reliability.

  ##### Labor Force Change
  Labor force change is calculated as the net change in labor force participants from 2006-2010 (ACS 5-Year Estimates) to 2016-2020 (ACS 5-Year Estimates) for all geographies. The U.S. Census Bureau defines population 16 years and older participating in the labor force as the full labor force. Change in labor force is reported for the total labor force (age 16 and older), labor force aged 25 to 54 years old, and labor force age 65 – of which the latter two are components of the total labor force change. The total labor force participant populations for all three age cohorts in 2006-2010 and 2016-2020 are included in the downloadable files but are not visualized in Metro Region Explorer.

  ### Housing

  ##### Total Housing Units
  The U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates Program 2021 Vintage data were used for housing unit counts for county and subregion geographies, while 2020 Redistricting data were used for municipality geographies.
  ##### Housing Tenure (Owner vs. Renter) and Building Size
  2016-2020 ACS 5-Year Estimates files are used for all geographies to report current housing characteristics pertaining to tenure and building size. Given lower statistical reliability associated with Census Tract-level data, measures are only reported at the municipality and larger geographic scale.

  Building size visualizes total housing units by units located in structures with 1 unit (typical of single-family homes), 2 to 4 units (smaller, but denser, buildings such as townhomes and walk-ups), and structures with 5 or more units (medium-large sized buildings). This summary of housing units by building size is calculated by DCP and does not include units located in mobile homes or vehicles. This measure illustrates lower density versus higher density residential development patterns. Housing tenure visualizes owner-occupied versus renter-occupied homes, but data include Census-reported vacant units for all geographies.

  ##### Housing Production (Units Permitted) and Production by Building Size
  To estimate housing production, DCP calculated the aggregate number of building permits issued for all municipalities using U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey (BPS). BPS files are annual data released by County or Permit-Issuing Place. Permit-issuing places are unique to the BPS and are not necessarily aligned with other Census reporting geographies. Housing production data represent the number of new housing units authorized by building permits, but do not account for demolition, alteration and other changes in supply. Therefore, production does not represent comprehensive change in housing supply for any given area. Coverage within this database may not reflect local records due to reporting issues (e.g., time lag, regulatory oversight), however, BPS files are used for methodological consistency across state boundaries, except for New York City.

  All permit data has been processed and reported for Census MCDs in New Jersey, Hudson Valley, and Connecticut municipalities. Boundaries for Long Island municipalities are modified for housing production data reporting and visualization due to discrepancies in how permits are tracked for Long Island jurisdictions. Some of Long Island’s incorporated villages (U.S. Census Designated Places) self-report building permit data to the county, whereas other areas and unincorporated areas such as hamlets do not self-report and permit data are allocated to the Town (U.S. Census MCD). The municipal geography visualized on Long Island for Housing Production maps represent permits reported by permit-issuing places within Towns, and the remaining balance for non-permit issuing jurisdictions allocated to the remainder of the Town areas. This results in lesser geographic accuracy for Long Island housing permit data than other regional geographies.

  For the latest permit counts within New York City, Metro Explorer uses the NYC Housing Permit Database release 2020Q4, as 2021 figures have not yet been published. NYC figures will be updated to 2021 with the next NYC Housing Permit Database release. Please visit DCP’s website for more information about the [Housing Database](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-housing-database.page#housingdevelopmentproject).

  <a id="jobs"></a>
  ### Jobs

  ##### Total Employment
  Total employment represents total public and private sector jobs, though it should be noted that data are taken from administrative records (i.e., payroll-registered employment covered by State unemployment insurance laws) and does not capture self-reported, independently contracted, or informal employment. Federal data are used for consistency in reporting across state boundaries. For county and larger geographies, total employment reflects the preliminary estimate of 2021 average annual employment as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)-based data files. Please refer to the [(U.S. BLS website)](https://www.bls.gov/cew/overview.htm#coverage) for more information regarding QCEW coverage. U.S. BLS QCEW data are not available at the municipal geography. For municipal employment estimates, DCP processed and aggregated U.S. Census Bureau Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) Work Area Characteristics data, which reports employment by U.S. Census Block. DCP geocoded LEHD LODES data to Metro Region Explorer municipal geographic boundaries where possible. LEHD is based on, but differs from, the BLS QCEW-reported employment, combining administrative and other (e.g., survey) data, tabulating and modeling data where data are not available. Therefore, municipal data will not sum to county or larger geography totals reported by Metro Region Explorer. The most recent LEHD release year is 2019 and represents a total – rather than average annual – employment figure.

  The county, subregion, and region data reflect the effects of Covid-19 through December 2021. For more information on NYC Metro employment and wages, please visit our interactive visualization and data platform, [NYC Metro Employment & Wage Trends](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.carper/viz/NYCMetroEmploymentWageTrends/MacroSectorDashboard).


  ##### Private Sector Employment by Industry Macro Sector
  Employment data are reported by industry “macro sector” and, to enhance geographic accuracy of job locations, are visualized using U.S. Census Tract-level employment data from the 2019 LEHD LODES Work Area Characteristics files. County and larger geographies’ reported employment are calculated using 2021 U.S. BLS QCEW County High-Level and Industry NAICS-based data files and represent average annual employment. Municipalities’ employment are calculated using 2019 LEHD LODES data, and represent total annual employment in each macro sector. All geographies report private sector employment by macro industry sector given disclosure challenges associated with public sector jobs data by industry [(more on public vs. private jobs data)](publicprivatejobs).

  Macro industry sectors represent aggregations of U.S. BLS NAICS 2-digit industry private sector employment data, which generally reflect industries' land use patterns. However, DCP-defined macro sectors may include jobs that are not exclusively representative of a single land use characteristic or development pattern (e.g., an industrial employer located in an office, or contains on-site office space). Metro Region Explorer therefore provides an impressionistic sense of job location and relative land use implications.  Links to more information about BLS NAICS categorizations can be found in the Sources section of this page. Jobs data are mapped in aggregate (all macro sectors combined as a dot density visualization), as well as individually mapped by macro sector. Industries are grouped as follows:

  - **Office-based jobs**: Office-based jobs include NAICS 51 Information; 52 Finance and Insurance; 53 Real Estate and Rental and Leasing; 54 Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services; 55 Management of Companies, and 56 Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services jobs. These jobs are generally located in commercial office buildings.
  - **Institutional jobs**: Institutional jobs include NAICS 61 Educational Services and 62 Health Care and Social Assistance. These jobs are typically located in campus-style facilities, or in smaller commercial office buildings – as is the case for local clinics and community-based services. Though reporting and visualization in the tool is limited to private sector employment, total institutional employment for all geographic summary levels is included in the data files available for download. Please refer to the following section for additional notes on public vs. private sector employment reporting.
  - **Industrial jobs**: Includes NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; 21 Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction; 22 Utilities; 23 Construction; 31-33 Manufacturing; 42 Wholesale Trade; and 48-49 Transportation and Warehousing. These jobs are generally land-intensive, found along freight corridors or in concentrated areas/specialized zones, such as ports. However, the categories are broad and might include some office-based employment, particularly for headquarters jobs within the sector (e.g., a construction company headquartered in Manhattan).
  - **Local Services jobs**: Includes NAICS 44-45 Retail Trade; 71 Arts, Entertainment and Recreation; and 72 Accommodation and Food Services, NAICS 81 Other Services [except Public Administration] (e.g., local miscellaneous services such as dry cleaners and mechanics), and NAICS 99 Unclassified. These jobs tend to be in smaller businesses and serve local communities and are highly distributed throughout the region.

  These groupings differ slightly from the [NAICS-defined super sectors](https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag_index_naics.htm), most notably in the DCP grouping of Retail Trade with Leisure and Hospitality sectors, rather than Trade, Transportation and Utilities super sector. This is to better reflect local retail versus industrial/wholesale retail.

  <a id="publicprivatejobs"></a>
  ##### Additional Notes on Private vs. Public Sector Employment Data

  As with all data, there are certain limitations encountered in using both U.S. BLS QCEW and U.S. Census Bureau LEHD employment datasets to map jobs by industry sector. Metro Region Explorer primarily uses private sector jobs data because public sector employment reporting encounters more substantial reporting challenges related to coverage and accuracy. U.S. BLS QCEW public sector employment data by NAICS 2-digit industry are not disclosed for select industry sectors and/or geographies, and therefore public employment is not consistently or comprehensively represented across regional geographies. Public sector employment is, however, more comprehensively represented in NAICS-defined super sector aggregations for county and larger geographies. NAICS super sectors similarly aggregate education and healthcare employment (“institutional” jobs), for which public sector employment accounts for at least 26% of total institutional jobs (where data are reported). Other super sectors showed much lower shares of public sector employment (less than 5%), where data were available. However, reporting inconsistency due to data disclosure in 2010 and 2021 renders a comparison between the two years imprecise, and therefore is not reported in this tool. Public sector estimates, however, are made available in the data for download at all geographic summaries for users interested in the general contribution of public sector education and healthcare employment to total institutional employment. Users should exercise caution, given that Federal, State, and Local reporting of public sector Institutional employment varies by county (and therefore subregion).

  LEHD distinguishes between public and private sector employment in its datasets at the NAICS-2 digit level, however, DCP finds that public data more frequently reflects “headquartering” issues. “Headquartering” error occurs when jobs are geographically assigned to a headquarters location rather than a place of employment. For example, LEHD data indicated more than 100,000 public sector education jobs were located on a single Census Block in Downtown Brooklyn, which is where the NYC Department of Education is headquartered. DCP presumes that these jobs include public school employees at their administrative headquarters, rather than their place of daily employment (the school in which they work). Visualization of institutional employment at the Census Tract geographic unit shown in Metro Region Explorer would reflect this inaccuracy, and therefore only private sector institutional employment is visualized. However, public sector institutional data are included in the data files for download at municipality and census tract geographic summary levels. Similar "headquartering" issues may occur in private employment data, though likely at a less impactful scale.

  ##### Private Employment Change
  Using U.S. BLS QCEW County High-Level NAICS-based data files, private employment change is represented as the change between 2010 and 2021 average annual private employment. Change is not represented for municipalities due to reliability concerns (e.g., geographic adjustments or recodification for Census Tracts in 2010 might misrepresent change calculated from 2010 and 2019). Change is mapped for four of the five super sectors, including office, institutional, industrial, and retail, leisure and hospitality employment, however “other services” employment change can be accessed by downloading the tables or shapefiles for county and larger geographies. Due to public sector data disclosure challenges, employment change for institutional jobs does not reflect any change in public education or healthcare employment.

  The county, subregion, and region data reflect the effects of Covid-19 through December 2021. For more information on NYC Metro employment and wages, please visit our interactive visualization and data platform, [NYC Metro Employment & Wage Trends](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.carper/viz/NYCMetroEmploymentWageTrends/MacroSectorDashboard).


  ##### Gross Domestic Product
  Gross domestic product (GDP) data, which represents “the value of goods and services produced in an area” are reported by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) by county in its Local Area Gross Domestic Product program. To estimate percent annual change in GDP from 2010 to 2020, GDP has been adjusted for inflation to 2020 dollars. For more information on how these data are generated and the estimation methodology, please visit the [BEA’s website](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp).

  <a id="balance"></a>
  ### Balance

  ##### Housing/Jobs Balance in 2000 and 2021
  Planners often examine the relationship between supply of housing and jobs – or the ratio of total housing units to total employment – for a given area. A “Housing/Jobs” indicator helps us understand and evaluate jobs access, or how effectively the resident labor force can access employment. The 2000 ratio uses 2000 U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census housing counts and U.S. BLS QCEW County-High Level NAICS-based data files average annual employment figures. In 2000, NYC public sector employment is reported at its headquarters location (largely in Manhattan). However, after 2017, the U.S. BLS correctly reports the workplace location for these jobs (e.g., teachers reported at their school location rather than NYC Department of Education headquarters office). DCP reallocated 2000 public sector employment by borough based on the proportion of public sector jobs by borough in 2021. While this may not reflect the actual allocation of public sector jobs in 2000, it makes for a more accurate comparison in exploring the shift in housing/jobs ratios from 2000 to 2021. The 2021 ratio uses the U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates Program 2021 Vintage reported housing units and the preliminary estimate for 2021 BLS QCEW average annual employment figures. Please refer to the Employment section regarding the universe of employment captured by the BLS. In our region, there was an average of 0.86 housing units per job in 2019, prior to Covid-19 and massive shifts in regional employment (in other words, on average, more than one worker lives in each household). It is not intrinsically good or bad for an area to be “jobs-intensive” or “housing-intensive.” However, the relationships between these areas have implications for our shared transit infrastructure, the fiscal condition of communities, and other aspects of how we live.

  ##### Shift in Housing/Jobs Balance, 2000 to 2021
  To represent the shift in housing/jobs balance, DCP calculated the change in the ratio of housing units/jobs in 2000 to the ratio of housing units/jobs in 2021. A negative shift represents an area that saw job gains outpace growth of housing supply, thereby becoming more jobs-intensive. A positive shift represents an area that saw housing change outpace jobs change, thereby becoming more housing-intensive.

  <a id="commuting"></a>
  ### Commuting
  Commuting data represent the pre-pandemic pattern of origin-destination movements for NYC workers, all regional residents for whom NYC is their workplace destination, and NYC residents, or all employed NYC residents irrespective of employment location. All commuting data are calculated using [IPUMS-USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) databases prepared by the University of Minnesota - available at [www.ipums.org](http://www.ipums.org). Commuting trends were calculated using U.S. Census Bureau ACS 2019 1-Year Estimates and U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census 2000 5% Sample files. Commuting patterns visualized as dot density maps use the most recent U.S. Census Bureau Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) dataset, representing a 5-year average from 2006 to 2010, and mapped to the U.S. Census Tract geography. The 2006-2010 file is used instead of the 2012-2016 file to represent a more complete order-of-magnitude for commuters; the latter file represents a methodological change to report solely known commuters and therefore undercounts total workers by more than 30%. CTPP data for 2006-2010 provide sub-county geographic patterns, however, ACS 2019 1-Year Estimates are used for data aggregations to provide the most current estimate possible. Therefore, dot density maps are for illustrative purposes only.

  These data do not represent the effects of Covid-19 on commuting patterns in the region. ACS 2020 1-Year Estimates are not considered to be reliable due to sampling errors caused by the pandemic, so 2019 is still depicted here. For more information about how commuting patterns were disrupted in 2020, please refer to our [2020 Travel Trends report](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9ae470177d134f7fb42dac3ed61e37ad) or visit our [NYC Metro Telework Capability Portal](https://dcp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/fa7934157342468c92ffec2f2cdeb253).

  ##### Commuter Flow Geographies
  Current commuter-flow data (as of June 2022) are only available at Residential Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) and Place of Work Public Use Microdata Area (PWPUMA) geographies for the full United States. These areas represent populations of 100,000 or more, which for suburban areas of the NYC Metro Region are often contiguous with counties. Residential PUMAs are different than Place of Work PUMAS, which accounts for the differing aggregations of counties for NYC Workers reported at place of residence and NYC residents reported at workplace. For NYC Workers, Sullivan and Ulster counties are combined for consistency with PUMA geographies. For NYC Residents, Sullivan and Ulster and Westchester and Putnam counties are combined for consistency with PWPUMA geographies. For consistency with other data reported in this tool, tabulations for commuting trends are therefore available solely at the county and subregional geographic levels.

  ##### Place of Work or Workplace
  The workplace destination is derived from a U.S. Census Bureau survey question, phrased as, "At what location did this person work LAST WEEK", and includes a follow-up question to identify the location where the person worked the most if that person had worked in multiple locations. Therefore, these data may capture irregular or uncommon commute patterns, such as a business trip.

  ##### NYC Workers at Place of Residence
  NYC Worker maps visualize and report information at the location of residence for NYC workers. This includes all regional residents for whom NYC is the workplace destination. For reporting NYC workers by borough, the color indicates the NYC borough where that worker is employed, and the dot is located at those NYC workers' places of residence. The change in NYC workers from 2000 to 2019 is also reported at place of residence. For areas outside of NYC, this represents the absolute change in NYC in-commuters from 2000 to 2019. Though not depicted here, in 2019 there were an estimated additional 65,000+ domestic in-commuters to NYC from areas outside the metro region.

  ##### NYC Residents at Place of Work
  NYC Residents maps visualize and report information at the location of work for NYC residents, and the dots represent workplace destination. For NYC resident maps, the color indicates NYC residents' borough of residence, or the borough that was the origin of the commute. This includes NYC residents working within NYC, and NYC residents out-commuting to work in the surrounding 26 counties.

  ##### Primary Mode of Travel to Work
  These maps visualize the reported primary means of transportation used to travel to work in the previous week. However, the data do not capture multiple modes of transportation used to complete commuters' trips. That is, the U.S. Census Bureau survey questionnaire indicates that a respondent should report the mode used for the longest distance if multiple modes were used. It would not, for example, report both subway and commuter rail for a single commuter and would solely represent whichever mode the commuter indicates was used for the longest leg of the journey. Furthermore, because the questionnaire reports the predominant mode used to travel to work in the previous week, this may capture some infrequent or irregular commute patterns. Modes are grouped and defined by the U.S. Census as follows:
    - **Car**: automobile, carpool (2 or more), truck, or van
    - **Bus**: bus, trolley bus, and streetcar, including public and private services
    - **Commuter rail**: represents the regional rail network (defined as the Census Bureau as those that have occasional crossings with vehicular or pedestrian traffic), and refer to either NJ Transit, MTA Long Island Rail Road, MTA Metro-North Railroad, or Amtrak.
    - **Subway/PATH**: represents commuters using rapid transit, including both the MTA NYCT Subway and Port Authority PATH train networks.
    - **Ferry**: ferryboat
    - **Bike/Walk**: bicycle or walking only
    - **Other**: includes taxi, motorcycle, or a different method of travel (e.g., plane)

  ### Data Reliability

  ##### Statistical Reliability
  Metro Region Explorer population and housing data and trend analyses frequently use ACS estimates to represent current data. ACS estimates are derived from a survey and are subject to sampling error. Consequently, all ACS estimates are published with Margins of Error (MOEs) at a 90% confidence level wherever available. Metro Region Explorer consistently uses ACS 5-Year estimates for all maps that report at municipal, county, and subregion geographies. These estimates provide the most reliable data for smaller geographies (i.e. municipalities) despite time lag [(more guidance on ACS files)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html). Other estimates (e.g., ACS 1-Year) are used when data is solely available at county and larger geographies with limited cross-tabulations. Though all data are visualized and mapped, grayed values in the pop-up box represent data deemed unreliable. Unreliable values indicate that the calculated coefficient of variation (CV) is greater than 20% and are not statistically significant at a 90% confidence level. In examining longitudinal change, DCP calculated margins of error for 2000 Decennial Census SF3 and 5% Sample data consistent with U.S. Census Bureau [guidelines](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/resources/codebooks/2000_PUMS_codebook.pdf) and [ACS guidelines](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/comparing-acs-data/2016.html), or used ACS-reported margins of error. For ACS data obtained via IPUMS-USA databases, DCP calculated error using replicate weights. For calculated change, grayed values represent changes that are not statistically reliable at the 90% confidence level, in which the calculated MOE associated with the calculated change represents a CV of 20% or greater. Data files available for download on this site contain all calculated MOEs and CVs associated with estimates or counts wherever possible. ACS data are subject to sampling variability, so these measures of reliability help to gauge the consistency of the ACS and the degree to which one can trust any given statistic. Additional information about the ACS and guidelines for using ACS data can be viewed on [DCP’s website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/american-community-survey.page), where you might also access tools like the [map reliability calculator](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/geographic-reference.page).

  ##### Geographic Accuracy and Precision
  Dot density visualizations represent data mapped within specific boundaries (i.e., Census Tract, municipality) and do not represent the actual location of people, housing units, or jobs. Dots are illustrative only and have been assigned a random location within the geographic boundaries. For dot density maps, dots are assigned a value to represent (e.g., 50 people, 100 jobs). In areas where no data are represented (no dots are mapped), values may fall below the selected threshold value and do not necessarily indicate a value of zero for the associated geography. In those cases, data are not visualized, but values are reported for all geographies.
