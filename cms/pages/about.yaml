  ## Methodology and Definitions
  Metro Region Explorer is built using publicly available Federal datasets that have been processed and/or analyzed by DCP. Federal data are used to maintain reporting consistency over time and across state boundaries. Population, housing, and economic datasets are released with varying publication frequency, geographic coverage and detail, as described below. When examining change over time, Metro Region Explorer focuses on two time periods: post-recession to today and 2000 to today. The post-recession period start year depends on the data product, but generally starts either in 2008 or 2010. Direct links to Federal sites can be in the [Data Sources](#data-sources) section.

  ### Geographies and Boundaries

  Information is provided for geographic entities at four scales (from largest to smallest): region, subregion, county, and municipality. U.S. Census Tract geographic entities are used to enhance geographic accuracy for select data visualizations, however, data are not reported at this level due to reliability concerns [(more on data reliability)](#data-reliability).

    ##### Region
    The tri-state NYC metro _region_ geography represents New York City and 26 surrounding counties in portions of New York, north New Jersey and southwest Connecticut. This definition of the region is a generally accepted modification of the U.S. Census Bureau combined statistical area (CSA) for New York-Newark-Bridgeport and roughly represents the NYC commuter shed. This area does not represent a regulatory or other jurisdictional boundary. The region geography is not visualized as a single entity in Metro Region Explorer, but data are reported for all characteristics in the tool and the shapefile is available for download.

    ##### Subregion
    The _subregion_ geography represents aggregations of U.S. counties, which are commonly used for transportation planning and other regional analyses. Counties are grouped as follows:
    - _New York City_: Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), New York (Manhattan), Queens, and Richmond (Staten Island)
    - _Inner New Jersey_: Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, and Union
    - _Outer New Jersey_: Hunterdon, Mercer, Monmouth, Ocean, Sussex, and Warren
    - _Long Island_: Nassau and Suffolk
    - _Connecticut_: Fairfield, Litchfield, and New Haven
    - _Lower Hudson Valley_: Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester
    - _Mid Hudson Valley_: Dutchess, Orange, Sullivan, and Ulster

    Please note that “Inner” and “Outer” New Jersey suggest NYC proximity and/or accessibility and do not indicate formalized geographic locations or jurisdictional boundaries.

    ##### County
    The _county_ geography is represented by the region’s 31 counties, including the five boroughs/counties of NYC and surrounding 26 counties listed above.

    ##### Municipality
    The _municipality_ geography represents approximations for cities, towns, and villages within the NYC metropolitan region. The boundaries represent U.S. Census Bureau Minor County Division (MCD) geographies for all counties in New Jersey, Connecticut, and the Hudson Valley; U.S. Census Bureau Places (Places) boundaries for Long Island, unless otherwise noted; and, to represent NYC at municipality-comparable scale, DCP used the sub-borough geographies defined in the 2013 edition of [The Newest New Yorkers](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/newest-new-yorkers-2013.page) report, “Chapter 3: Settlement Patterns”. NYC geographies represent aggregations of U.S. Census Bureau Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). It is important to note that “municipalities” represented in this tool do not imply or consistently represent jurisdictional boundaries or governance authority. The purpose of this geography is to enable consistent longitudinal socioeconomic analysis across the region at comparable scale. When changes were detected within the study period (e.g., consolidation, renaming), data were recoded. However, it is possible that inaccuracies in the data reflect additional changes to municipal borders or Census-defined geographic entities over this period. Municipality data are not visualized for select maps due to availability limitations or reliability concerns [(more about data reliability)](#data-reliability).

  <a id="people"></a>
  ### People

  ##### Population and Population Density
  U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census population counts are used for all geographies in 2000 and 2010. To measure the current population total, U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates Program 2016 estimates are used for county and larger geographies, and 2012-2016 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates files, which represent an average over the period 2012-2016, are used for Municipality geographies. ACS 5-Year files provide the most reliable data for geographies with populations of 20,000 or less, of which there are more than 850 municipalities by Metro Region Explorer definition in the NYC metropolitan region [(more about data reliability)](data-reliability). Population densities are calculated using land areas provided by the U.S. Census Bureau MAF/TIGER database.
  ##### Population Change
  Population change from 2010 to 2016 for county and larger geographies is represented as the change between the 2010 Decennial Census population count and the 2016 Population Estimates Program (PEP) estimate; neither source reports margins of error. Net population change from 2010 to 2016 at the municipal geography is visualized for all municipalities as the net difference between the 2006-2010 ACS 5-Year Estimate and 2012-2016 ACS 5-Year Estimate population estimates.
  ##### Percent Foreign-born
  Percent foreign-born is calculated as total population born outside of the United States over the total population estimate using the 2012-2016 ACS 5-Year Estimates for all geographies.
  ##### Labor Force Change
  Labor force change is calculated as the net change in labor force participants from 2000 (2000 Decennial Census) to today (2012-2016 ACS 5-Year Estimates). The U.S. Census Bureau defines population 16 years and older participating in the labor force as the full labor force. The “prime-age labor force” is commonly referenced as population aged 25 to 54. Change in prime-age labor force is calculated as the net difference between total labor force participants age 25 to 54 in 2000 and total labor force participants age 25 to 54 in the current period. Change in total labor force participants (age 16 and older) was similarly calculated. Labor force participant populations for both the total labor force and prime-age labor force in 2000 and 2012-2016 are included in the downloadable files, but are not visualized in Metro Region Explorer.

  <a id="housing"></a>
  ### Housing

  ##### Housing Units, Tenure (Owner vs. Renter), and Building Size
  2012-2016 ACS 5-Year Estimates files are used for all geographies to report current housing characteristics. Building size, which visualizes total housing units by units located in structures with 1-2 units (smaller buildings) versus structures with 3 or more units (medium-large sized buildings), is calculated by DCP and does not include units located in mobile homes or vehicles. This measure illustrates lower density versus higher density residential development patterns. Housing tenure and building size data are visualized at the U.S. Census Tract geographic unit for the purpose of enhancing geographic accuracy; however, given statistical reliability of tract-level data, measures are reported at the municipality and larger geographic scale.
  ##### Housing Production (Units Permitted) and Production by Building Size
  To estimate housing production, DCP calculated the aggregate number of building permits issued for all municipalities using U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey (BPS). BPS files are annual data released by County or U.S. Census Place. Housing production data represent the number of new housing units authorized by building permits, but do not account for demolition and other changes in supply. Therefore, production does not represent comprehensive change in housing supply for any given area. Coverage within this database may not reflect local records due to reporting issues (e.g., time lag, regulatory oversight), however, BPS files are used for methodological consistency across state boundaries.

  All permit data has been processed and reported for Census MCDs in New Jersey, Hudson Valley, and Connecticut municipalities. Although orders of magnitude are consistent with U.S. Census Bureau BPS-reported figures, DCP has adjusted NYC permit data for consistency with City reporting standards. Boundaries for Long Island municipalities are modified for housing production data and visualization due to reporting discrepancies for Long Island jurisdictions. Long Island’s incorporated villages (U.S. Census Places) self-report building permit data to the county, whereas unincorporated areas (also Places) do not self-report and permit data are allocated to the Town (U.S. Census MCD). The municipal geography visualized on Long Island for Housing Production maps represent permits reported by incorporated villages within Towns with the remaining permits allocated to the unincorporated Town areas. This results in lesser geographic accuracy for Long Island housing permit data than other regional geographies.

  ### Jobs

  ##### Total Employment
  Total employment represents public and private sector jobs, though it should be noted that data are taken from administrative records and may not capture informal or other forms of self-reported employment. Federal data are used for consistency in reporting across state boundaries. For county and larger geographies, total employment reflects 2016 average annual employment as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)-based data files. U.S. BLS QCEW data are not available at the municipal geography. For municipal employment estimates, DCP processed and aggregated U.S. Census Bureau Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) data, which reports employment by U.S. Census Block. DCP geocoded data to Metro Region Explorer municipal geographic boundaries. LEHD is based on, but differs from, the BLS QCEW-reported employment, combining administrative and other (e.g., survey) data. Therefore, municipal data will not sum to county or larger geography totals reported by Metro Region Explorer. The most recent LEHD release year is 2015, and represents a total – rather than average annual – employment figure.
  ##### Employment by Sector
  Employment data are reported by industry “macro sector” and, to enhance geographic accuracy of job locations, are visualized using U.S. Census Tract-level geographies’ employment data from the 2015 LEHD LODES Work Area Characteristics files. County and larger geographies’ reported employment are calculated using 2016 U.S. BLS QCEW County High-Level and Industry NAICS-based data files, and represent average annual employment. Municipality geographies’ employment are calculated using 2015 LEHD LODES data, and represent total annual employment. All geographies report private sector employment by industry unless otherwise indicated [(more on public vs. private jobs data)](publicprivatejobs).

  Industry macro sectors represent aggregations of U.S. BLS NAICS 2-digit industry sector employment data, which reflect land use patterns associated with certain kinds of professions. Links to more information about BLS NAICS categorizations can be found in the Sources section of this page. Jobs data are mapped in aggregate (all macro sectors combined), as well individually mapped by macro sector. Industries are grouped as follows:

  - **Office-based jobs**: Office-based jobs include NAICS 51 Information; 52 Finance and Insurance; 53 Real Estate and Rental and Leasing; 54 Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services; 55 Management of Companies, and 56 Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services jobs. These jobs are generally located in commercial office buildings.
  - **Institutional jobs**: Institutional jobs include NAICS 61 Educational Services and 62 Health Care and Social Assistance. These jobs are typically located in campus-style facilities, or in smaller commercial office buildings – as is the case for local clinics and community-based services. Unlike the other macro sectors, reporting for these jobs in the current year includes public sector employment and may reflect inaccurate visualization or geographic concentration (see note below).
  - **Industrial jobs**: Includes NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; 21 Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction; 22 Utilities; 23 Construction; 31-33 Manufacturing; 42 Wholesale Trade; and 48-49 Transportation and Warehousing. These jobs are generally land-intensive, found along freight corridors or in concentrated areas/specialized zones, such as ports. However, the categories are broad and might include some office-based employment, particularly for headquarters jobs within the sector.
  - **Retail, Leisure and Hospitality jobs**: Includes NAICS 44-45 Retail Trade; 71 Arts, Entertainment and Recreation; and 72 Accommodation and Food Services. These jobs tend to be locally serving, and are found throughout the region.
  - **Other Services jobs**: Includes NAICS 81 Other Services [except Public Administration], which includes local miscellaneous services such as dry cleaners and mechanics.

  These groupings differ slightly from the [NAICS-defined super sectors](https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag_index_naics.htm), most notably in the DCP grouping of Retail Trade with Leisure and Hospitality sectors, rather than Trade, Transportation and Utilities super sector. This is to better reflect local retail versus industrial/wholesale retail. As a result of using NAICS 2-digit industry sector categorizations, DCP-defined macro sectors may include jobs that are not exclusively representative of a single land use characteristic or development pattern (e.g., an industrial job that also contains office space). Metro Region Explorer provides an impressionistic sense of job location and relative land use implications.

  <a id="publicprivatejobs"></a>
  ##### Additional Notes on Private vs. Public Sector Employment Data

  As with all data, there are certain limitations encountered in using both U.S. BLS QCEW and U.S. Census Bureau LEHD employment datasets to map jobs by industry sector. Metro Region Explorer primarily uses private sector jobs data, because public sector employment reporting encounters more substantial reporting challenges related to coverage and accuracy. U.S. BLS QCEW public sector employment data by NAICS-2 digit industry are not disclosed for select industry sectors and/or geographies, and therefore public employment is not consistently or comprehensively represented across regional geographies. Public sector employment is, however, more comprehensively represented in NAICS-defined super sector aggregations for county and larger geographies. NAICS super sectors similarly aggregate education and healthcare employment (Institutional jobs), for which public sector employment accounts for over 25% of total institutional jobs. Other super sectors showed much lower shares of public sector employment (less than 5%), where data were available. Public sector estimates are therefore included in the institutional jobs to more precisely reflect the scale of public education and healthcare employment as contributing to total institutional employment.

  LEHD distinguishes between public and private sector employment in its datasets at the NAICS-2 digit level, however, DCP finds that public data more frequently reflects “headquartering” issues. “Headquartering” error occurs when jobs are geographically assigned to a headquarters location rather than a place of employment. For example, LEHD data indicated more than 100,000 public sector education jobs were located on a single Census Block in Downtown Brooklyn, which is where the NYC Department of Education is headquartered. DCP presumes that these jobs include public school employees at their administrative headquarters, rather than their place of daily employment (the school in which they work). Visualization of institutional employment at the Census Tract geographic unit shown in Metro Region Explorer would reflect this inaccuracy. Similar issues may occur in private employment data, likely at a considerably smaller scale.

  ##### Private Employment Change
  Using U.S. BLS QCEW County High-Level NAICS-based data files, private employment change is represented as the change between 2008 and 2016 average annual private employment. Change is not represented for municipalities due to reliability concerns (e.g., geocode changes for Census Tracts in 2010 might misrepresent change calculated from 2008 to 2015). Change is also included for four of the five super sectors, including office, institutional, industrial, and retail, leisure and hospitality employment. Due to public sector data disclosure challenges, employment change for institutional jobs does not reflect any change in public education or healthcare employment.

  <a id="balance"></a>
  ### Balance

  ##### Housing/Jobs Balance in 2000 and 2016
  Planners often examine the relationship between supply of housing and jobs – or the ratio of total housing units to total employment – for a given area. A “Housing/Jobs” indicator helps us understand and evaluate jobs access, or how effectively the resident labor force can access employment. The 2000 ratio uses 2000 U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census housing counts and U.S. BLS QCEW County-High Level NAICS-based data files average annual employment figures. The 2016 ratio uses 2012-2016 ACS 5-Year Estimates housing units and 2016 BLS QCEW average annual employment figures. In our region, there is an average of 0.87 housing units per job (in other words, on average, more than one worker lives in each household). It is not intrinsically good or bad for an area to be “jobs-intensive” or “housing-intensive.” However, the relationships between these areas have implications for our shared transit infrastructure, the fiscal condition of communities, and other aspects of how we live.
  ##### Shift in Housing/Jobs Balance, 2000 to 2016
  To represent the shift in housing/jobs balance, DCP calculated the change in the ratio of housing units/jobs in 2000 to the ratio of housing units/jobs in 2016. A negative shift represents an area that saw job gains outpace growth of housing supply, thereby becoming more jobs-intensive. A positive shift represents an area that saw housing change outpace jobs change, thereby becoming more housing-intensive.

  <a id="commuting"></a>
  ### Commuting
  Commuting data represent origin-destination movements for NYC workers, all regional residentsfor whom NYC is their workplace destination, and NYC residents, or all employed NYC residents irrespective of employment location. All commuting data are calculated using [IPUMS-USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) databases prepared by the University of Minnesota - available at [www.ipums.org](http://www.ipums.org). Commuting trends were calculated using U.S. Census Bureau ACS 2017 1-Year Estimates and U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census 2000 5% Sample files. Commuting patterns visualized as dot density maps use the most recent U.S. Census Bureau Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) dataset, representing a 5-year average from 2006 to 2010. CTPP data provide better sub-county geographic patterns, however, ACS 2017 1-Year Estimates are used for data aggregations to provide the most current estimate possible. Therefore, dot density maps are for illustrative purposes only.

  ##### Commuter Flow Geographies
  Current commuter-flow data (as of February 2019) are only available at Residential Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) and Place of Work Public Use Microdata Area (PWPUMA) gegoraphies for the full United States. These areas represent populations of 100,000 or more, which for suburban areas of the NYC Metro Region are often contiguous with counties. Residential PUMAs are different than Place of Work PUMAS, which accounts for the differing aggregations of counties for NYC Workers reported at place of residence and NYC residents reported at workplace. For NYC Workers, Sullivan and Ulster counties are combined for consistency with PUMA geographies. For NYC Residents, Sullivan and Ulster and Westchester and Putnam counties are combined for consistency with PWPUMA geographies. For consistency with other data reported in this tool, tabulations for commuting trends are therefore available solely at the county and subregional geographic levels.

  ##### Place of Work or Workplace
  The workplace destination is derived from a U.S. Census Bureau survey question, phrased as, "At what location did this person work LAST WEEK", and includes a follow-up question to identify the location where the person worked the most if that person had worked in multiple locations. Therefore, these data may capture irregular or uncommon commute patterns, such as a business trip.

  ##### NYC Workers at Place of Residence
  NYC Worker maps visulaize and report information at the location of residence for NYC workers. This includes all regional residents for whom NYC is the workplace destination. For reporting NYC workers by borough, the color indicates the NYC borough where that worker is employed, and the dot is located at those NYC workers' places of residence. The change in NYC workers from 2000 to 2017 is also reported at place of residence. For areas outside of NYC, this represents the absolute change in NYC in-commuters from 2000 to 2017. Though not depicted here, in 2017 there were an estimated additional 64,000 domestic in-commuters to NYC from areas outside the metro region.

  ##### NYC Residents at Place of Work
  NYC Residents maps visualize and report information at the location of work for NYC residents, and the dots represent workplace destination. For NYC resident maps, the color indicates NYC residents' borough of residence, or the borough that was the origin of the commute. This includes NYC residents working within NYC, and NYC residents out-commuting to work in the surrounding 26 counties.

  ##### Primary Mode of Travel to Work
  These maps visualize the reported primary means of transportation used to travel to work in the previous week. However, the data do not capture multiple modes of transportation used to complete commuters' trips. That is, the U.S. Census Bureau survey questionnaire indicates that a respondent should report the mode used for the longest distance if multiple modes were used. It would not, for example, report both subway and commuter rail for a single commuter, and would solely represent whichever mode the commuter indicates was used for the longest leg of the journey. Furthermore, because the questionnaire reports the predominant mode used to travel to work in the previous week, this may capture some infrequent or irregular commute patterns. Modes are grouped and defined by the U.S. Census as follows:
    - **Car**: automobile, carpool (2 or more), truck, or van
    - **Bus**: bus, trolley bus, and streetcar, including public and private services
    - **Commuter rail**: represents the regional rail network (defined as the Census Bureau as those that have occasional crossings with vehicular or pedestrian traffic), and refer to either NJ Transit, MTA Long Island Rail Road, MTA Metro-North Railroad, or Amtrak.
    - **Subway/PATH**: represents commuters using rapid transit, including both the MTA NYCT Subway and Port Authority PATH train networks.
    - **Ferry**: ferryboat
    - **Bike/Walk**: bicycle or walking only
    - **Other**: includes taxi, motorcycle, or a different method of travel (e.g., plane)

  ### Data Reliability

  ##### Statistical Reliability
  Metro Region Explorer population and housing data and trend analyses frequently use ACS estimates to represent current data. ACS estimates are derived from a survey and are subject to sampling error. Consequently, all ACS estimates are published with Margins of Error (MOEs) at a 90% confidence level wherever available. Metro Region Explorer consistently uses ACS 5-Year estimates for all maps that report at municipal, county, and subregion geographies. These estimates provide the most reliable data for smaller geographies (i.e. municipalities) despite time lag [(more guidance on ACS files)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html). Other estimates (e.g., ACS 1-Year) are used when data is solely available at county and larger geographies. Though all data are visualized and mapped, grayed values in the pop-up box represent data deemed unreliable. Unreliable values indicate that the calculated coefficient of variation (CV) is greater than 20% and are not statistically significant at a 90% confidence level. In examining longitudinal change, DCP calculated margins of error for 2000 Decennial Census SF3 and 5% Sample data consistent with U.S. Census Bureau [guidelines](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/resources/codebooks/2000_PUMS_codebook.pdf) and [ACS guidelines](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/comparing-acs-data/2016.html), or used ACS-reported margins of error. For ACS data obtained via IPUMS-USA databases, DCP calculated error using replicate weights. For calculated change, grayed values represent changes that are not statistically reliable at the 90% confidence level, in which the calculated MOE associated with the calculated change represents a CV of 20% or greater. Data files available for download on this site contain all calculated MOEs and CVs associated with estimates or counts wherever possible. ACS data are subject to sampling variability, so these measures of reliability help to gauge the consistency of the ACS and the degree to which one can trust any given statistic. Additional information about the ACS and guidelines for using ACS data can be viewed on [DCP’s website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/american-community-survey.page), where you might also access tools like the [map reliability calculator](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/geographic-reference.page).
  ##### Geographic Accuracy and Precision
  Dot density visualizations represent data mapped within specific boundaries (i.e. Census Tract, municipality) and do not represent the actual location of people, housing units, or jobs. Dots are illustrative only and have been assigned a random location within the geographic boundaries. For dot density maps, dots are assigned a value to represent (e.g., 50 people, 100 jobs). In areas where no data are represented (no dots are mapped), values may fall below the selected threshold value and do not necessarily indicate a value of zero for the associated geography. In those cases, data are not visualized, but values are reported for all geographies.
