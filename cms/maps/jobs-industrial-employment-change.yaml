          From 2008 to 2018, the NYC metro region lost 61k Industrial jobs (-0.3% per year), with the NYC and Outer New Jersey subregions registering modest Industrial employment gains. The Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for nearly half of metro industrial job losses, and Connecticut accounted for about one-quarter of losses. Mirroring national trends of a declining Industrial economy, the post-recession period reflects a continued trend within the NYC metro region, which lost 241k Industrial jobs from 2000 to 2008 (-1.5% per year). Industrial losses were driven mostly by declines in manufacturing employment, representing about 80% of industrial job losses, followed by job losses in the wholesale trade sectors. Slight gains in construction, transportation and warehousing sectors (mostly in NYC and the Outer New Jersey subregions) drove growth among the few counties registering Industrial job gains. The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Middlesex and Mercer counties, NJ, are among the growing counties, areas that house port infrastructure or track major road networks (e.g., the I-95 corridor).

  Sources & Notes: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) NAICS-Based Data Files, Annual Average 2008 & 2018. Industrial sectors might include headquarters employment or businesses classified as industrial occupying more traditional office-type facilities. Therefore, losses registered in places such as Manhattan more likely reflect loss of office-based, rather than traditional manufacturing facility-based, employment.
