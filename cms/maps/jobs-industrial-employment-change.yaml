          From 2008 to 2016, the NYC metro region lost 112,973 industrial jobs, with NYC and Outer New Jersey subregions registering the smallest employment losses. The Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for half of metro industrial job losses, and Connectictut accounted for about one-quarter of losses. Mirroring national trends of a declining industrial economy, the post-recession period reflects a continued trend within the NYC metro region, which lost 241,354 industrial jobs from 2000 to 2008. Industrial losses were driven mostly by declines in manufacturing employment, representing about 70% of all job losses, followed by losses in the wholesale trade sectors. Slight gains in construction, transportation and warehousing sectors (mostly in NYC and the Outer New Jersey subregions) drove growth among the few counties registering industrial job gains, including the Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, and Mercer County, NJ.

  Sources & Notes: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) NAICS-Based Data Files, Annual Average 2008 & 2016. Industrial sectors might include headquarters employment or businesses classified as industrial occupying more traditional office-type facilities. Therefore, losses registered in places such as Manhattan more likely reflect loss of office-based, rather than traditional manufacturing facility-based, employment.
