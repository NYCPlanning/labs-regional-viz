  Sources & Notes: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) NAICS-Based Data Files, Annual Average 2010 and 2021. Industrial sectors might include headquarters employment or businesses classified as industrial occupying more traditional office-type facilities. Therefore, losses registered in places such as Manhattan more likely reflect loss of office-based, rather than traditional manufacturing facility-based, employment. See [About](/about/#jobs) for more information about employment.
