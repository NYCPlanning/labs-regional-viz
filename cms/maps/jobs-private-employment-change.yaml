  In the period from 2008 to 2018, the NYC metro region gained 920k private-sector jobs, increasing from 8.22 million average annual private jobs in 2008 to 9.14 million in 2018. Job growth was mostly located in NYC (73% of regional net gain), which is now experiencing its highest levels of recorded employment, while many areas of the region are just now returning to pre-recession levels of employment. As a whole, the region’s rate of employment growth grew at pace with the national average, and slower than other large regions such as San Francisco, Seattle, and Dallas.

  Nearly every county in the 31-county region lost private jobs from 2008 to 2009. NYC rebounded the fastest from recession losses and had the largest net gain by 2018, adding 674k jobs and growing at an average rate of 2.2% per year. The rest of the region added a total of 246k jobs and grew on average at 0.5% per year from 2008 to 2018. Long Island accounted for the second largest net gain (+75k), and the Inner New Jersey subregion, which accounts for 22% of the region’s private jobs, represented just 7% of regional post-recession employment growth (+64k). Within New Jersey, gains in Hudson, Somerset, and Middlesex counties helped balance losses in Passaic, Essex, and Union counties.
