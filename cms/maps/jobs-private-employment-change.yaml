  In the period from 2008 to 2016, the NYC metro region gained 631,120 private-sector jobs, increasing from 8.07 million average annual private jobs in 2008 to 8.85 million in 2016. Job growth was mostly located in NYC, which is now experiencing its highest levels of recorded employment, while many areas of the region are just now returning to pre-recession levels of employment. As a whole, the region’s rate of employment growth underperformed the national average and that of other large regions such as San Francisco, Seattle, and Boston.

  Nearly every county in the 31-county region lost private jobs from 2008 to 2009. NYC rebounded the fastest from recession losses and had the largest net gain by 2016, adding 497,225 jobs and growing at 2% per year. The rest of the region added a total of 133,900 jobs and grew on average at 0.3% per year from 2008 to 2016.  NYC accounted for 80% of the region’s total private employment gain during this period. Long Island accounted for the second largest net gain (+58,150), and the Inner NJ subregion, which accounts for 22% of the region’s private jobs, represented just 2% of regional post-recession employment growth (+10,550). Within NJ, gains in Hudson and Middlesex counties helped balance losses in Passaic, Essex and Union counties.
