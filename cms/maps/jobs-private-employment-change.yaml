content: |
  Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the NYC Metro gained +1.1 million private sector jobs from 2008 to 2019, increasing from 8.2 to 9.3 million. NYC accounted for 73% of private sector job growth in the years after the Great Recession, adding +787k jobs and growing at an average rate of +2.2% per year. In 2019, NYC experienced its highest levels of recorded employment, while many areas of the region were just returning to pre-Great Recession levels of employment.

  Covid-19 and resulting shutdowns initiated an unprecedented employment loss for the NYC Metro. From January to August 2020, the NYC Metro’s private sector employment base shrank from 9.52M to 8.46M jobs, a loss of 11%. Over the same period, NYC lost 602k jobs (-15%), northern New Jersey lost 233k jobs (-8%), Long Island lost 103k jobs (-9%), the Hudson Valley lost 71k jobs (-9%), and southwest Connecticut lost 53k jobs (-7%).  Gains since August 2020 have driven a modest rebound in employment.
