  The NYC metro region gained 924k private sector jobs since the Great Recession, increasing from 8.22 million in 2008 to 9.15 million in 2018. NYC accounted for 73% of private sector job growth, adding 675k jobs and growing at an average rate of 2.2% per year. NYC is now experiencing its highest levels of recorded employment, while many areas of the region are just now returning to pre-recession levels of employment. As a whole, the region’s post-recession rate of employment growth (+1.1% per year) was at pace with the national average (+1.0% per year), but slower than other large metropolitan regions such as San Francisco, Seattle, and Dallas.

  Nearly every county in the 31-county region lost private sector jobs from 2008 to 2009. NYC rebounded the fastest from recession losses, with all five NYC boroughs registering job gains. The rest of the region added a total of 249k jobs and grew on average at 0.5% per year from 2008 to 2018. Long Island accounted for the second largest net gain (+76k), and the Inner New Jersey subregion, which accounts for 22% of the region’s private jobs, represented just 7% of regional post-recession private sector employment growth (+65k). Within New Jersey, gains in Hudson, Middlesex, Ocean, and Somerset counties helped balance losses in Essex, Passaic, and Union counties.

  NYC's share of the region's employment growth represents a departure from previous economic cycles. NYC accounted for approximately one-third of the region's pre-recession job growth from 2000 to 2008, and 36% of the region's private sector job growth from 1990 to 2000.
