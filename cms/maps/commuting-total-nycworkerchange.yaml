content: |
  From 2000 to 2019, the city’s workforce grew by 1.1 million workers, representing a 29% increase. This map shows the change in the number of people who are employed in NYC from 2000 to 2019, at their residence location (i.e. NYC commuters' county or subregion of origin). Over that time period, the NYC resident workforce grew by +29% (+843k), while the NYC in-commuter workforce grew by +31% (+243k). As a result, in-commuters represent a slightly larger component of the NYC workforce today than in 2000.

  Since 2000, there has been an increase of +150k (+49%) Inner and Outer New Jersey (northern New Jersey) residents traveling to NYC for work, accounting for approximately two-thirds of total NYC in-commuter gains. Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties combined (+107k) accounted for 44% of the total NYC in-commuter increase. In-commuting from the Hudson Valley and Connecticut increased by +54k combined (+26%), while in-commuting from Long Island grew slightly less than in-commuting to the city from the north (+39k), and at a slower rate (+14%).
