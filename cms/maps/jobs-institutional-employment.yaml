menuTitle: "Institutional Employment"
content: |
  The region employs nearly 2.2 million people in private sector education and healthcare jobs. NYC accounted for 979k jobs, representing 45% of the region’s private sector Institutional employment.

  83% of the region's private sector institutional jobs are in healthcare, 1.7 million jobs, and 365k jobs are in education, which includes private schools and universities. Private sector institutional employment is most concentrated at the region’s large academic institutions and hospitals, but are also found in proportion to population size, as this category includes local healthcare facilities (e.g., doctor and dentist offices), home health aide services, and social services.

  The institutional macro sector additionally employs more than 755,000 people in public sector jobs in the region, most notably in local and State education. Public sector institutional employment generally mirrors population distribution throughout the tri-state area.

  Among the four macro industry sectors represented on the Metro Explorer (office, institutional, industrial, local services), Institutional employment has by far the highest share of jobs in the public sector - approximately 26% of total institutional jobs are in the public sector and 74% are in the private sector. The other three macro industry sectors average below 5% of total employment in the public sector. However, due to data disclosure challenges (as well as reporting challenges for change over time), Metro Explorer solely visualizes private sector institutional employment and change over time. However, total Institutional employment estimates (inclusive of public sector jobs) are available for download on the [About](/about/) page. Please refer to notes on [public and private sector employment](/about/#publicprivatejobs) for more detail.
