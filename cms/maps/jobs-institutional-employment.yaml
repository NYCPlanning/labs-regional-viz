  The NYC metro region is home to 2.7 million average annual jobs in the education and healthcare sector, representing 40%, which includes public and private sector employment. Close to three-quarters of the region's institutional employment was in private sector education and healthcare, 1.96 million jobs representing 72% of the total institutional employment. Institutional employment is most concentrated at the regionâ€™s large academic institutions and hospitals, but institutional jobs also track population size, as it relates to locally serving schools and healthcare facilities.
