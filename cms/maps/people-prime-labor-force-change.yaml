menuTitle: Age 25-54 Labor Force Change, 2010 to 2017
content: |
  Workers between the ages of 25 and 54 (prime-age) are increasingly choosing to reside in the center of our region, particularly within NYC, which has gained over 400,000 labor force participants aged 25 to 54 since 2000. Areas proximate to NYC or well-connected by public transit -- like Bridgeport, Hempstead, Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, New Brunswick, New Haven, Stamford, and Yonkers –also experienced increases in these resident workers. The rate of NYC's prime-age labor force growth (gain of 17 %) was nearly three times higher than the U.S. average (gain of 6%), which increased more slowly as the baby-boomer cohort grew older and was replaced by younger, smaller population cohorts. Though there are many areas in the region that lost prime-age labor force, areas that outpaced the U.S. growth within the region are experiencing increased in-migration, which offsets losses due to existing population aging out of the workforce.

  Historically, NYC has consistently attracted large numbers of people in their 20s, with people in their 30s+ more likely to move out of than into the city ([learn about historic NYC migration characteristics](http://migration.planning.nyc.gov/#age)). Today, fewer people in their 30s are moving out of NYC. Out-migrants from the city are more likely to leave for other parts of the U.S. than for the metro region, resulting in prime-age population declines for much of the region’s suburban areas.
