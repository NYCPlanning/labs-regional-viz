menuTitle: Age 25-54 Labor Force Change, 2010 to 2020
content: |
  From 2010 to 2020, the region lost 148k workers between the ages of 25 and 54 (the “prime” labor force cohort). This represents a decrease of 1.9% and a departure from the cohort’s growth rate of 5% between 2000 and 2010. Similarly, the U.S. prime labor force cohort grew by only 0.3% from 2010 to 2020.
  Within our region, this cohort of workers is increasingly choosing to reside in the center of our region, particularly within NYC, which has gained over 113k (+3.9%) labor force participants aged 25 to 54 since 2010. Though most parts of the region lost labor force participants aged 25-54, areas proximate to NYC or regional transit also experienced modest increases in these resident workers, outpacing the U.S. growth rate.
