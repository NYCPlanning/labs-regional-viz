title: "The NYC metro region’s labor force is aging."
menuTitle: Age 65+ Labor Force Change, 2010 to 2018
content: |
  Today’s regional labor force is relatively young as compared to the U.S. on average. Of the region’s 11.8 million labor force participants, 695k are over 65, comprising 5.9% of our labor force. However, like other parts of the U.S., our labor force is growing older as workers stay in the labor force longer, and as the labor force is joined by fewer younger workers.

  Since 2010, the NYC metro region gained more than +209k labor force participants aged 65 and older. That growth of +43.1% was slightly lower than the national average growth of +44.4%. As a result, 5.9% of the current regional workforce is over age 65, as compared with 4.3% of the workforce age 65 and older in 2010.

  In the U.S., growth of labor force participants aged 65 and older accounted for one-third of labor force gains on average. Within our region, NYC gained the largest number of labor force participants aged 65 and older (+69k) in the region, but that accounted for only 28% of NYC’s total labor force growth. In contrast, the increase in labor force participants aged 65 and older accounted for approximately 44% of net labor force gains in Inner NJ and 37% in the Lower Hudson Valley, and the vast majority of net gains in the Long Island (88%) and Connecticut (81%). In Outer NJ, the gain of older workers (+25k) exceeded that subregion’s net labor force gains (+5k), offsetting losses of younger workers.
