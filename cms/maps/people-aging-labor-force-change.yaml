menuTitle: Age 65+ Labor Force Change, 2010 to 2020
content: |
  Today’s regional labor force is relatively young by US standards. Of the region’s 11.9 million labor force participants, 722k are over 65, comprising 6.1% of our labor force. However, like other parts of the U.S., our labor force is growing older as workers stay in the labor force longer, and as the labor force is joined by fewer younger workers.

  Since 2010, the NYC Metro gained more than +237k labor force participants aged 65 and older. That growth of +48.7% was slightly lower than the national average growth of +51.4%. As a result, 6.1% of the current regional workforce is over age 65, as compared with 4.3% of the workforce age 65 and older in 2010.

  In the U.S., growth of labor force participants aged 65 and older accounted for one-third of labor force gains on average. Within our region, NYC gained the largest number of labor force participants aged 65 and older (+77k) in the region, but that accounted for only 30% of NYC’s total labor force growth. In contrast, the increase in labor force participants aged 65 and older accounted for approximately 49% of net labor force gains in Inner NJ and 42% in the Lower Hudson Valley, and the vast majority of net gains in the Long Island (90%) and Connecticut (97%). In Outer NJ, the gain of older workers (+28k) exceeded that subregion’s net labor force gains (+8k), offsetting losses of younger workers. In the Mid Hudson Valley, gains in labor force participants aged 65 and older (+11k) were insufficient to offset losses in labor force participants under age 65, resulting in a net labor force loss of -7k.
