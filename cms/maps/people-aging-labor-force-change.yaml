menuTitle: Age 65+ Labor Force Change, 2010 to 2017
content: |
  Since 2010, the NYC metro region gained more than 188,000 labor force participants aged 65 and older. That growth of 38.8% was slightly higher than the national average growth of 38.5%. NYC gained the largest number of labor force participants aged 65 and older (+62,500) in the region, but those workers accounted for the smallest share of any subregion’s total labor force growth, representing just 20% of the city’s total gain. In the U.S., growth of labor force participants aged 65 and older accounted for one-third of labor force gains on average.  The increase in labor force participants aged 65 and older notably contributed to labor force growth in areas outside of NYC, accounting for one-third of net labor force gain in Inner NJ and the Lower Hudson Valley to two-thirds of the net labor force gain in Long Island and Connecticut. In Outer NJ, the gain of older workers (+22,000) exceeded that subregion’s net labor force gains (+9,000), offsetting losses of younger workers.
