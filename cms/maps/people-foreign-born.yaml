menuTitle: "% Foreign Born"
content: |
  With 6.2 million foreign-born residents from 110 countries, the regionâ€™s immigrants are an integral part of our communities and workforce, representing 27% of our total population and 34% of our resident labor force. Of the total regional foreign-born population, about half reside in NYC and half outside the city, with high concentrations in northern New Jersey, Rockland County, southern Westchester County, and select areas in Long Island and coastal Connecticut. Foreign-born residents represent a significant share of the population and workforce in growing areas, while areas without significant foreign-born population are often shrinking as the baby-boomer generation ages and reaches retirement.
