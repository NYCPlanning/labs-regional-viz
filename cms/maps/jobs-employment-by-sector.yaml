menuTitle: "Private Sector Employment by Macro Industry"
content: |
  The region's <b>9.15 million private sector jobs</b> represent a diverse mix of Office-based, Institutional, Industrial, and Local Services employment, generating <b>$707 billion in employee wages</b>. The location of jobs within the region roughly mirrors population distribution, with the densest concentrations of employment in NYC (particularly in Manhattan), but also significant levels of employment spread throughout the tri-state area. In 2018, NYC accounted for 42% of the region's total private sector employment, 3.80 million jobs, and 51% of the region's total private sector wages, $360 billion. Manhattan alone represents 24% of the region's private sector employment, 2.23 million jobs, and 40% of the region's employee wages. Outside of NYC, 5.34 million private sector jobs provide employment for regional residents, including nearly 300k NYC residents who commute out of the city for work.

  This map illustrates the location and mix of those private sector jobs by macro industry. <b>2.8 million Office-based jobs</b>, such as those in information, financial services, and other professional services, represent 30% of our region's private sector employment. Office sector jobs are most concentrated in Midtown and Lower Manhattan, which represents 41% of the region's Office jobs and averages approximately 51k office jobs per square mile. Other Office clusters are found in the region’s downtown centers, like Jersey City, Newark, and Stamford (between 30k-50k total office jobs each), or are found in more linear concentrations in the region’s suburban areas, as in Melville (Long Island) and Parsippany-Troy Hills (NJ).

  <b>2.1 million Local Services jobs</b> represent the second-largest share of the region's employment (28%). Those jobs include community-based services such as retail, food services, leisure, and other local services (e.g., laundromats and auto repair). These jobs generally mirror population distribution throughout the region.

  <b>2.02 million Institutional jobs</b> represent nearly one-quarter of the region's private sector employment, with 1.7 million jobs in healthcare and 353,000 in education jobs. Private institutional jobs are most concentrated at the region’s large academic institutions and hospitals. There are also an additional 754,000 public sector institutional workers in state and local educational faciltiies, which are not represented on this map but also track population size and distribution.

  The region's <b>1.7 million Industrial jobs</b>, including construction, manufacturing, and logistics, are most concentrated near ports, airports, and transportation facilities. Because of the Industrial sector's land-intensiveness, there is a greater share of Industrial employment outside of NYC than within (unlike all other sectors).

Private sector employment by industry macro sector generally reflects workers covered by State unemployment insurance laws and does not include public sector or other forms of employment.
