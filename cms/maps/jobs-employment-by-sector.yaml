menuTitle: "Employment by Industry Sector"
content: |
  The location of jobs within the region roughly mirrors population distribution, with the densest concentrations of employment in NYC (particularly in Manhattan), but also significant levels of employment spread throughout the tri-state area.

  In 2018, NYC accounted for 41% of the metro region’s 10.6 million jobs and half of the region’s $834 billion in annual worker wages. Manhattan alone accounted for 2.5 million jobs and $312 billion in annual worker wages – the highest for any county in the U.S. – representing 23% of the region’s total jobs and 37% of regional wages. Outside of NYC, there were 6.2 million jobs providing employment for regional residents, including nearly 300,000 NYC residents.

  Office sector jobs are most concentrated in Manhattan, which accounted for 41% of the region’s 2.8 million private sector office-based jobs and averaged about 51,000 office jobs per square mile. Other office clusters are found in the region’s downtown centers, like Jersey City, Newark, and Stamford (between 30,000-50,000 office jobs each), or are found in more linear concentrations in the region’s suburban areas, as in Melville (Long Island) and Parsippany-Troy Hills (NJ). Institutional employment is most concentrated at the region’s large academic institutions and hospitals, but these jobs also track population size, as related to locally serving schools and healthcare facilities. Industrial employment is most concentrated near ports, airports, and transportation facilities, and because of its land-intensiveness, exists in greater share outside of NYC than within (unlike all other sectors). Retail and hospitality employment exists throughout the region, with the highest concentrations in densely populated areas or at regional malls.
