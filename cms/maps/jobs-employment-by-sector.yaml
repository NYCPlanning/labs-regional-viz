menuTitle: "Private Sector Employment by Macro Industry"
content: |
  The region's <b>8.6 million private sector jobs</b> in 2021 represent a diverse mix of office-based, institutional, industrial, and local services employment, generating <b>$798 billion in employee wages</b>.

  The location of jobs within the region roughly mirrors population distribution, with the densest concentrations of employment in NYC (particularly in Manhattan), but also significant levels of employment spread throughout the tri-state area. In 2021, NYC accounted for 41% of the region's total private sector employment, 3.5 million jobs, and 52% of the region's total private sector wages, $413 billion. Manhattan alone represents 23% of the region's private sector employment (2.0 million jobs) and 41% of the region's employee wages. Outside of NYC, 5.1 million private sector jobs provide employment for regional residents.

  This map illustrates the location and mix of those private sector jobs by macro industry. <b>2.69 million office-based jobs</b>, such as those in information, financial services, and other professional services, represent 27% of our region's private sector employment. Office sector jobs are most concentrated in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Other office clusters are found in the region’s downtown centers, like Jersey City, Newark, and Stamford, or are found in more linear concentrations in the region’s suburban areas, as in Melville (Long Island) and Parsippany-Troy Hills (NJ).

  <b>2.11 million institutional jobs</b> represent 21% of the region's employment, with the majority of jobs in healthcare and the remainder in private education. Private institutional jobs are most concentrated at the region’s large academic institutions and hospitals. There are also a significant number of additional public sector institutional workers in federal, state and local educational facilities, which are not represented on this map but also track population size and distribution.

  <b>2.15 million local services jobs</b> represent nearly one-quarter of the region's private sector employment. Those jobs include community-based services such as retail, food services, leisure, and other local services (e.g., laundromats and auto repair). These jobs generally mirror population distribution throughout the region. Employment in this macro sector was especially hard-hit during the Covid-19 pandemic.

  The region's <b>1.64 million industrial jobs</b>, including construction, manufacturing, and logistics, are most concentrated near ports, airports, and transportation facilities. Because of the Industrial sector's land-intensiveness, there is a greater share of Industrial employment outside of NYC than within (unlike all other sectors).

Private sector employment by industry macro sector generally reflects workers covered by State unemployment insurance laws and does not include public sector or other forms of employment.
