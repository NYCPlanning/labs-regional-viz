  Office-based jobs include employment in finance and insurance, real estate, information, administration, professional, technical and other business services sectors. NYC was home to 1.4 million private office-based jobs in 2018, 50% of the region's total office-based employment (2.77 million). 41% of the region's office-based jobs were located in Manhattan, and 9% were located in the other NYC boroughs. Other office clusters are found in the region’s downtown centers, like Jersey City, Newark, and Stamford (between 30k-50k office jobs each), or are found in more linear concentrations in the region’s suburban areas, as in Melville (Long Island) and Parsippany-Troy Hills (Inner NJ).
