content: |
  Nearly 325,000 new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2016 – the equivalent of the total housing stock of Seattle being added in a six-year period. NYC accounted for 44% of new housing (142,000 units) and the Inner NJ subregion accounted for 29% (95,000 units). Housing development in Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley subregions combined accounted for just 17% of new permitted units. Nearly three-quarters of the total permitted units were in buildings that have 3 or units (235,000 units), with only 90,000 units permitted in buildings with 1-2 units, which are characteristic of lower-density areas.

  Today the region has 3.8 million households in buildings with 3 or more units, of which NYC accounts for 63% (2.4 million units) and the Inner NJ subregion accounts for 17% (667,000 units. Areas in north New Jersey proximate to NYC, especially those well connected by regional rail transit, are adding significant amounts of multifamily housing. Since 2010, NYC accounted for 57% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with 3+ units (133,000 units), slightly lower than its regional share, and Inner NJ accounted for 28% of the region’s permitted units in 3+ unit structures (66,000 units), higher than its regional share of units in such buildings. These are the areas that are also experiencing considerable population and labor force growth.
