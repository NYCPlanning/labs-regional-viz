  <p class="lead">The <strong><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/planning">NYC Department of City Planning</a> Metro Region Explorer</strong> enables you to explore population, housing, and employment trends within the tri-state New York City Metropolitan Region.</p>

  NYC is the center of a large region that spans across city, county and state boundaries. Though we are governed independently, many of our planning challenges are interconnected, and our future is intertwined with the future of our larger region. This tool was developed as part of our ongoing commitment to helping the public access and understand information about planning issues affecting our city and region.
