  <p class="lead">The <strong><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/planning">NYC Department of City Planning</a> Metro Region Explorer</strong> enables you to explore population, housing, and employment trends within the tri-state New York City Metropolitan Region.</p>

  NYC is the center of a large metropolitan area that spans across city, county, and state boundaries. Though we are governed independently, many of our planning challenges are interconnected, and our City’s future is intertwined with the future of our larger region. This tool was developed as part of NYC Planning’s ongoing commitment to helping the public access and understand information about planning issues affecting our city and region.

  Using data from a range of publicly available sources, the Metro Region Explorer allows you to view socioeconomic characteristics across 7 subregions, 31 counties, and nearly 900 cities, towns, villages, and hamlets ([more about the data and geographies](/about)). Learn more by clicking through below or by navigating directly to maps by topic area.

  NYC Metro Explorer was last updated with new data on <b>August 13, 2020</b>. Because of the time lag in many sources, the information shared on the Metro Region Explorer currently reflects regional trends preceding COVID-19 and its ongoing impact on regional demographic, economic, and housing patterns.
