menuTitle: "Total Employment"
content: |
  The location of jobs within the region roughly mirrors population distribution, with the densest concentrations of employment in NYC (particularly in Manhattan), but also significant levels of employment spread throughout the tri-state area.

  In 2016, NYC accounted for 41% of the metro region’s 10.3 million jobs and about half of the region’s $744 billion in annual worker wages. Manhattan alone accounted for 2.4 million jobs and $274 billion in annual worker wages – the highest for any county in the U.S. – representing 24% of the region’s total jobs and 37% of regional wages. Outside of NYC, there were 6.1 million jobs providing employment for regional residents, including 400,000 NYC residents.
