content: |
        Private sector Institutional employment (jobs in the education and healthcare sectors) grew by 26% (+433k) region-wide, with every county in the region registering growth in private institutional jobs. Brooklyn gained the most and grew the fastest among metro region counties, growing private institutional employment by 43% and adding 103k jobs from 2008 to 2018. Manhattan (+63k), Queens (+47k), and Nassau County, LI (+34k) also exhibited significant growth. Private institutional growth was driven by healthcare job gains, most notably in private ambulatory sectors (e.g., physicians, dentists, local medical services). Private ambulatory job growth accounted for more than 222k jobs and half of all private institutional job gains.

        Though institutional jobs consistently represent about one-quarter of NYC metro subregions' 2018 private sector employment, institutional job growth accounted for half to near all of the net private jobs gains for non-NYC subregions, helping to offset job losses in other sectors. About one-third of NYC's net private sector job gains were institutional jobs. Institutional jobs also grew the fastest for all subregions, averaging a 26% increase from 2008 to 2018. These gains show the importance of institutional sectors in supporting the region's post-recession economy, especially in areas outside of NYC.
