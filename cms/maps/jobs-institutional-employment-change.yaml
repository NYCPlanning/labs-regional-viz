    From 2010 to 2019, private sector institutional employment (jobs in the education and healthcare sectors) went up by 448k, with every county in the region adding jobs. Healthcare job gains, most notably in private ambulatory sectors (e.g., physicians, dentists, home health aides, and other local medical services), drove Institutional macro sector job gains. In NYC, the majority of that growth was attributed to increases in home health care jobs. The growth of this industry has been influenced by public policy decisions, including expanded access to insurance, as well as broader population changes.

    Though institutional jobs consistently represented about one-quarter of NYC metro subregions' 2019 private sector employment, institutional job growth accounted for more than three quarters of jobs gains across non-NYC subregions, helping to offset pandemic-related job losses in other macro sectors.

    Inclusive of job losses resulting from the pandemic, the NYC Metro added 384k private institutional sector jobs between 2010 and 2021. NYC represented 65% of the region’s job gains despite being 46% of private sector institutional jobs in 2021. Brooklyn added the most private sector institutional jobs between 2010 and 2020 (+126k), followed by Queens (+58k) and Manhattan (+50k).
