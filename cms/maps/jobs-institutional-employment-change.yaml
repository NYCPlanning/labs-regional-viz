content: |
        Private sector institutional employment (jobs in the education and healthcare sectors) grew by +2.8% per year in the region (+510k jobs), slightly faster than the national average (+2.6%), with every county in the region adding jobs. Brooklyn gained the most private sector institutional jobs and grew the fastest among metro region counties, growing by +7.1% per year and adding 127k jobs from 2008 to 2019. Manhattan (+74k), Queens (+59k), and Nassau County, LI (+40k) also experienced significant growth. Healthcare job gains, most notably in private ambulatory sectors (e.g., physicians, dentists, home health aides, and other local medical services), drove Institutional macro sector job gains. There were more than +265k ambulatory healthcare services jobs added, representing half of all private sector institutional job gains. In NYC, the majority of that growth was attributed to increases in home health care jobs. The growth of this industry has been influenced by public policy decisions, including expanded access to insurance, as well as broader population changes.

        Though institutional jobs consistently represent about one-quarter of NYC metro subregions' 2019 private sector employment, institutional job growth accounted for more than three quarters of jobs gains across non-NYC subregions, helping to offset job losses in other sectors. More than one-third of NYC's net private sector job gains were in the institutional macro sector (37%). Institutional jobs also grew the fastest for all subregions, averaging a +31% increase from 2008 to 2019. These gains show the importance of Institutional sectors in supporting the region's post-recession economy, especially in areas outside of NYC.
