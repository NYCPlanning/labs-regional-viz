content: |
  Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the NYC Metro grew its GDP by $285 billion from 2010 to 2020 (in 2020-dollars), representing an increase of 1.6% per year. NYC, which grew its GDP by $240 billion from 2010 to 2020, accounted for 84% of the region’s net GDP growth, growing by 3.1% per year. NYC’s rate of growth was faster than the U.S. on average (+2.0% per year).

  Brooklyn grew GDP the fastest among NYC metro region counties (+3.8% per year), followed by Manhattan (+3.3% per year). Southwest Connecticut was the only subregion that experienced a loss in GDP, of $2.2 billion, while the other subregions all grew in GDP but more slowly than the city.
