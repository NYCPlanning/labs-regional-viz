  From 2010 to 2016, NYC grew its population by 362,540 and accounted for 61% of the total regional gain of 598,842 people. NYC's share of regional growth was much higher than its share of regional population (37%).  Inner NJ, which represents 23% of the region's total population (5.1 million) accounted for 27% of the region's population growth since 2010. Hudson County, NJ saw the fastest rate of growth among metro counties, while the Bronx was the second-fastest growing county. The outer ring of counties lost population in this period.
