  Recent growth patterns suggest that more people are moving to and staying in our region, with a focus on the urban core and in areas well-connected to rail transit. This is especially true for NYC, which accounted for 61% of regional population growth since 2010, and has seen a slowing of residents leaving for other locations in the United States. The Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 27% of regional population growth, with Hudson County, New Jersey experiencing the fastest rate of population growth (+6.9%) in the region, and Bergen, Middlesex, Ocean, Somerset and Union outpacing the regional average. Rockland (NY) and Fairfield (CT) counties also outpaced the regional average, while inner counties of Essex, Morris, Nassau, Passaic and Staten Island showed slower rates of growth. Less central parts of the region, which led growth during the second half of the 20th century, are generally not growing today.
