  Recent growth patterns suggest that more people moved to and stayed in our region, with a focus on the urban core and in areas well-connected to transit. This is especially true for NYC, which accounted for 47% of regional population growth since 2010, despite housing just 37% of the region’s population. Brooklyn (+231k), Queens (+175k), Manhattan (+108k) saw the largest population gains in the region, followed by Hudson County, New Jersey (+91k) and the Bronx (+88k). Hudson County saw the fastest rate of population growth (+14.3%) of any county in the region, and every municipality within Hudson County saw population increases. Within suburban counties closest to NYC, population growth concentrated in urban centers along rail corridors, such as Bridgeport, Elizabeth, Hempstead, Newark, New Rochelle, Paterson, and Stamford, and in other areas proximate to NYC – notably southern Westchester County and western Nassau County. Though historically international in-migration has been an important factor in NYC’s growth, this is now increasingly true elsewhere in the region. Less central parts of the region, which led growth during the second half of the 20th century, are generally not growing today, with the exception of Ocean County, New Jersey. Ocean County is the only county in the region where population growth was driven by positive domestic migration over the last decade, meaning that more people moved to Ocean County from elsewhere in the U.S. (including the region) than left the county for elsewhere in the U.S. since 2010.
