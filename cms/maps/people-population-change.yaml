  Recent growth patterns suggest that more people moved to and stayed in our region, with a focus on the urban core and in areas well-connected to transit. This is especially true for NYC, which accounted for 53% of regional population growth since 2010, despite housing just 37% of the region’s population, and has seen a slowing of residents leaving for other locations in the United States. Brooklyn (+78k), Queens (+48k), and the Bronx (+47k) saw the largest population gains in the region, followed by Hudson County, New Jersey. Hudson County saw the fastest rate of population growth (+6.6%) of any county in the region, as well as the largest net population gain (+42k) outside of NYC, and every municipality within Hudson County saw population increases. Within suburban counties closest to NYC, population growth concentrated in urban centers along rail corridors, such as Bridgeport, Elizabeth, Hempstead, Newark, New Brunswick, New Rochelle, and Stamford, and in other areas proximate to NYC – notably southern Westchester County and western Nassau County. Less central parts of the region, which led growth during the second half of the 20th century, are generally not growing today. Though historically international in-migration has been an important factor in NYC’s growth, this is now increasingly true elsewhere in the region.
