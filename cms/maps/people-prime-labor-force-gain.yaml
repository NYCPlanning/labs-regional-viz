content: |
  Workers between the ages of 25 and 54 (prime-age) are increasingly choosing to reside in the center of our region, particularly within NYC, which has gained over 400,000 labor force participants aged 25 to 54 since 2000. Areas proximate to NYC or well-connected by public transit -- like Jersey City, Hoboken, Newark, New Brunswick, Yonkers, Hempstead, Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven – are also experiencing increases in these resident workers. Overall, declines in population aged 25 to 54 are consistent with national trends, as the baby-boomer cohort grows older and is replaced by younger, smaller population cohorts. Areas that are defying this national trend are experiencing increased in-migration, which offsets losses due to the population aging out of the workforce.

  Historically, NYC has consistently attracted large numbers of people in their 20s, with people in their 30s+ more likely to move out of than into the city ([learn about historic NYC migration characteristics](http://migration.planning.nyc.gov/#age)). Today, fewer people in their 30s are moving out of NYC. Out-migrants from the city are more likely to leave for other parts of the U.S. than for the metro region, as seen in the chart below – resulting in prime-age population declines for much of the region’s suburban areas.
