menuTitle: "Housing Production (Units Permitted), 2010 to 2019"
content: |
  Nearly 508k new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2019 – more than of the total housing stock of the City of San Francisco in a nine-year period. While in absolute terms a large number, these housing permits represent the equivalent of a +6% increase over the region’s existing housing supply. Permit figures may include significant home repairs/rebuilds following major climate events like Hurricane Irene or Superstorm Sandy, as well as other types of residential renovation.

  Across the region, the production of new housing was highly concentrated in NYC, which accounted for 43% of new housing (220k units), and the Inner NJ subregion, which accounted for 30% (154k units). Housing development in Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley subregions combined accounted for just 17% of new permitted units, despite accounting for 31% of existing housing and 32% of the population (respectively).
