menuTitle: "Housing Production (Units Permitted), 2010 to 2021"
content: |
  More than 635k new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2021 â€“ about the size of the total housing stock of New Hampshire. The production of new housing has been highly concentrated in NYC, which accounted for 41% of new housing (261k units) over the last decade, and the Inner NJ subregion, which accounted for 32% (201k units). Housing development in the Long Island, Southwest Connecticut, and Hudson Valley subregions combined to account for just 18% of new permitted units, despite being home to 30% of existing housing and 32% of the population (respectively).

For municipalities, housing permit data reflect U.S. Census Bureau building permitting geographies, a different boundary than the municipality boundary represented in other maps. For NYC sub-borough area on the municipality layer, data were only available through 2020. 2021 data were not available below the county (i.e., borough) level at the time of this update.
