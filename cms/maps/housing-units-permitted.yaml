menuTitle: "Housing Production (Units Permitted), 2010 to 2020"
content: |
  Greater than 572k new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2020 â€“ more than of the total housing stock of the City of San Diego in a ten-year period. Permit figures may include significant home repairs/rebuilds following major climate events like Hurricane Irene or Superstorm Sandy, as well as other types of residential renovation.

  Across the region, the production of new housing was highly concentrated in NYC, which accounted for 42% of new housing (241k units), and the Inner NJ subregion, which accounted for 31% (178k units). Housing development in Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley subregions combined accounted for just 17% of new permitted units, despite accounting for 31% of existing housing and 31% of the population (respectively).
