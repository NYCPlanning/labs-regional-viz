content: |
  Nearly 325,000 new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2016 – the equivalent of the total housing stock of Seattle in a six-year period. While in absolute terms a large number, these housing permits represent the equivalent of a 3.5% increase over the region’s existing housing supply, slightly outpacing with the rate of regional population increase (+2.7%) over the same time period. It should be noted, however, that permit figures might include significant home repairs/rebuilds following major climate events like Hurricane Irene or Superstorm Sandy, as well as other types of residential renovation.

  Across the region, the production of new housing was highly concentrated in NYC, which accounted for 44% of new housing (142,000 units), and the Inner NJ subregion, which accounted for 29% (95,000 units). Housing development in Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley subregions combined accounted for just 17% of new permitted units, despite accounting for 30% of existing housing and 32% of population.
