    The NYC metro region saw a net increase of 176k office-based jobs since the recession, with NYC's gain of 192k office jobs offsetting losses elsewhere in the region. All five NYC boroughs gained office employment post-recession, and though 49% of the region's private office-based jobs are located in NYC, NYC accounted for 82% of office job gains experienced by growing counties (such as Hudson and Somerset counties in New Jersey). Brooklyn had the fastest rate of private office job growth, an increase of 43% from 2008 to 2018, while Manhattan saw the largest increase (+142k). Most NYC metro region counties lost office jobs in the finance and insurance sectors (a total regional loss of 24k), but gained jobs in professional and business services sectors (a regional increase of 145k). Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Fairfield County, CT were the only three counties in the metro region that gained information sector jobs post-recession, of which Manhattan accounted for 84% (+38k).
