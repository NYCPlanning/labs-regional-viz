menuTitle: "Office Employment Change, 2008 to 2019"
content: |
    The NYC metro region gained +228k office-based private sector jobs since the recession. However, NYC's gain of +241k office jobs offset losses experienced elsewhere in the region. All five NYC boroughs gained office employment post-recession, with Manhattan adding the most (+187k) and Brooklyn growing the fastest (+4.3% per year) since 2008. Though 51% of the region's private sector office jobs are located in NYC, NYC accounted for 83% of office job gains experienced by growing counties (such as Hudson and Somerset counties in New Jersey). Most NYC metro region counties lost office jobs in the finance, insurance, and real estate sectors (a total regional loss of -18k), but gained jobs in professional, administrative, and other business services sectors (a regional increase of +242k). Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Fairfield County, CT were the only three counties in the metro region that gained information sector jobs post-recession, of which Manhattan accounted for 87% (+45k).
