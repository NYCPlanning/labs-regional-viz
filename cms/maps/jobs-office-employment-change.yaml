    In the wake of the Great Recession from 2008 to 2019, the NYC Metro gained +228k office-based private sector jobs, with NYC's gain of +241k office jobs offsetting losses experienced elsewhere in the region. All five NYC boroughs gained office employment from 2008 to 2019, with Manhattan adding the most (+187k) and Brooklyn growing the fastest (+4.3% per year). Though 51% of the region's private sector office jobs were located in NYC in 2019, NYC accounted for 83% of office job gains experienced by growing counties.

    The Covid-19 pandemic and job losses in 2020 reduced the NYC Metro’s post-2008 office employment growth to +52k and NYC office sector gains +142k. Outside of NYC, Hudson County, NJ experienced office job growth (+8k), while Bergen County, NJ (-18k) and Nassau County, NY (-21k) saw the steepest declines. Notably, this macro sector employs the highest share of [telework-capable jobs]( https://dcp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/fa7934157342468c92ffec2f2cdeb253).
