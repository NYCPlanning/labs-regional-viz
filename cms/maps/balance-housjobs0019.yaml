  Examining the change from 2000 to 2019, or the housing/jobs ratio in 2000 subtracted from the ratio in 2019, sheds light on how balance is geographically shifting within the region. Areas that shifted toward a greater proportion of housing to jobs are represented in the orange spectrum, and areas with employment gains that outpaced housing change are represented in blue; areas in yellow represent marginal shifts.

  From 2000 to 2019, a period of tremendous growth for NYC, all five boroughs trended towards a more even balance of housing and jobs. The growth of Manhattan’s housing stock exceeded its change in employment, while historic employment growth in Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island outpaced strong housing production*.

  Though the Inner New Jersey subregion has grown housing supply at about the same rate as NYC since 2000 (9% and 10%, respectively), making a significant contribution to meeting the housing needs of the region, this was not complemented by commensurate employment growth. This area of the region, which accounts for 22% of the region’s total employment, accounted for just 4% of the region’s employment growth since 2000. As job growth fails to keep up with housing development, northern New Jersey residents are becoming more dependent on NYC for employment opportunities, which is reflected by growth in the trans-Hudson commuter population.

  As certain areas of the region gain jobs but little housing (Long Island), or gain housing but few jobs (Inner New Jersey), shifts in balance affect commuting patterns and the demands placed on regional transportation infrastructure.

Appropriate allocation of jobs to place-of-work in 2019 accounts for slight additional shifts towards more jobs intensive ratios for non-Manhattan boroughs in 2019.
