menuTitle: "Population Density"
content: |
  Our region is home to a wide diversity of built environments, from skyscraper districts in Manhattan to the farms of the Hudson Valley. NYCâ€™s neighborhoods range in densities from 7k people per square mile in lower density areas like central and south Staten Island to over 100k people per square mile in East Midtown. Areas in northern New Jersey, Nassau County, southern Westchester County, as well as historic downtowns along our regional rail lines, typically have higher population densities (upwards of 10k people per square mile). Suburban and outer areas of the region tend to be much lower density (under 2k people per square mile).
