menuTitle: "Industrial Employment"
content: |
  The NYC metropolitan region is home to 1.74 million private sector industrial jobs generating $135 billion in employee wages in 2019. Industrial jobs include manufacturing, construction, utilities, transportation and warehousing, and wholesale trade employment. 29% of the region's industrial employment (501k) is based in NYC. Industrial employment also includes some office headquarters employment for industrial businesses, which is especially true for industrial jobs located in places like Manhattan. Industrial employment is most concentrated near ports, airports, transportation facilities, and along major highways, and because of its land-intensiveness, exists in greater share outside of NYC than within (unlike all other sectors).
