menuTitle: "Industrial Employment"
content: |
  The NYC metropolitan region is home to 1.67 million private-sector industrial jobs. Industrial jobs include manufacturing, construction, utilities, transportation and warehousing, and wholesale employment. 29% of the region's industrial employment (483,000) is based in NYC. Industrial employment also includes some office headquarters employment for industrial businesses, which is especially true for industrial jobs located in places like Manhattan. Industrial employment is most concentrated near ports, airports, and transportation facilities, and because of its land-intensiveness, exists in greater share outside of NYC than within (unlike all other sectors).
