menuTitle: "Housing by Building Size"
content: |
  This map shows the location of the region's housing units by the size of the structure (or building) in which those homes are located. Homes located in buildings with one-two units are indicated in yellow, and homes located in buildings that contain three or more housing units are indicated in orange.

  Of the region's nearly 9 million homes, 43% are located in buildings with three or more units (3.8 million homes) while 57% are one-two family homes. Buildings with three or more units, typical of medium or larger multifamily buildings, are concentrated in NYC, areas proximate to rail transit, or in the region's historic downtowns, while lower-density housing types are spread more widely across the region.
