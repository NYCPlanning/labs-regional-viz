menuTitle: "Housing Units, Owner- vs. Renter-Occupied"
content: |
  Of the region’s nearly 9 million homes, 3.8 million are renter-occupied and 4.3 million are owner-occupied. Among U.S. metropolitan areas, our region’s 46% rental share of total housing is second only to Los Angeles (48% rental share, 2.8 million renter of 5.9 million households), an important feature of our region’s success in accommodating a dynamic population. NYC’s 3.4 million homes represent 38% of the region’s housing, and NYC’s 2.1 million renter-occupied units represent 56% of the region’s renter households. Other concentrations of rental housing are found in the metro’s historically denser cities – Newark (111,000 housing units, 66% rental), Elizabeth, Jersey City, New Haven, Paterson, and Yonkers – as well as in newer Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) centers like Harrison, NJ, and New Rochelle, NY. As has been the case nationally, there has been an increase in the construction of multifamily housing, including rental housing, in locations throughout the region since the recession.
