menuTitle: "Housing Units, Owner- vs. Renter-Occupied"
content: |
  Of the region’s 8.3 million occupied homes in 2018, 3.9 million are renter-occupied and 4.4 million are owner-occupied. Among large U.S. metropolitan areas, our region’s 47% rental share of total housing is second only to Los Angeles (48% rental share, 2.8 million renter-occupied of 6.0 million occupied households), an important feature of our region’s success in accommodating a dynamic population. NYC’s 3.54 million homes represent 39% of the region’s housing, and NYC’s 2.14 million renter-occupied units represent 55% of the region’s renter households. Other concentrations of rental housing are found in the metro’s historically denser cities – Newark (97k occupied housing units, 77% rental), Bridgeport, Elizabeth, Jersey City, New Haven, Paterson, and Yonkers – as well as in newer Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) centers like Harrison, NJ, and New Rochelle, NY. As has been the case nationally, there has been an increase in the construction of multifamily housing, including rental housing, in locations throughout the region since the recession.
