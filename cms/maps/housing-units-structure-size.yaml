menuTitle: "Housing Units by Building Size"
content: |
  This map shows the location of the region's housing units by the size of the structure (or building) in which those homes are located. Homes located in buildings with one unit, a detached or attached single-family home, are indicated in yellow. Homes located in buildings that contain two to four housing units (i.e., multifamily buildings) are indicated in light orange, and homes located in buildings with five or more units are indicated in crimson.

  Of the region's 9.19 million homes in 2019, 46% are in buildings with one unit (4.2 million homes) while 18% (1.6 million) are two-to-four family homes. 3.3 million, or 36% of homes, are in buildings with five or more units. Those buildings, typical of medium or larger multifamily buildings, are concentrated in NYC (where two-thirds of 5+ unit buildings are located), as well as in areas proximate to rail transit, or in the region's historic downtowns. Lower-density housing types are spread more widely across the region.
