  Examining the change from 2000 to 2016, or the housing/jobs ratio in 2000 subtracted from the ratio in 2016, sheds light on how balance is geographically shifting within the region. Areas that shifted toward a greater proportion of housing to jobs are represented in the orange spectrum, and areas with employment gains that outpaced housing change are represented in green; areas in yellow represent marginal shifts.

  From 2000 to 2016, a period of tremendous growth for NYC, all five boroughs trended towards a more even balance of housing and jobs. The growth of Manhattan’s housing stock exceeded its change in employment, while historic employment growth in Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island outpaced strong housing production.

  Though the Inner NJ subregion has produced housing at about the same rate as NYC since 2000 (both grew by about 7%), making a significant contribution to meeting the housing needs of the region, this was not complemented by commensurate employment growth. This area of the region, which accounts for 23% of the region’s total employment, lost jobs from 2000 to 2016. As job growth fails to keep up with housing, Inner NJ residents are becoming more dependent on NYC for employment opportunities, which is reflected by growth in the trans-Hudson commuter population.

  As certain areas of the region gain jobs but little housing (Long Island), or gain housing but few jobs (Inner NJ), shifts in balance affect commuting patterns and the demands placed on regional transportation infrastructure.
