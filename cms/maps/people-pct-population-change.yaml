  Since 2010, the region has continued to grow at faster rates in the center of the region, in NYC and areas close to the city. NYC’s population has grown +2.0% since 2010, with Manhattan (+2.7%), the Bronx (+2.4%) and Brooklyn (+2.1%) growing faster, and Staten Island (+1.6%) and Queens (+1.0%) growing slower. NYC accounted for 50% of regional population growth since 2010. The Inner New Jersey (+2.4%) and Lower Hudson Valley (+2.3%) subregions grew at a slightly faster than NYC. Hudson County, New Jersey experienced the fastest rate of population growth (+6.0%) of any county in the region, followed by Ocean County, New Jersey (+5.3%) and Rockland County, New York (+4.5%). With the exception of Ocean County, less central parts of the region, which led growth during the second half of the 20th century, are generally not growing today.
