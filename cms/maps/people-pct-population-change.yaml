  Since 2010, the region has continued to grow at faster rates in the center of the region, in NYC and areas close to the city. NYC’s population has grown +7.7% since 2010, with Brooklyn (+9.2%) and Queens (+7.8%) growing faster, and Manhattan (+6.8%), the Bronx (+6.3%) and Staten Island (+5.8%) growing slower. NYC accounted for 47% of regional population growth since 2010. The Inner New Jersey (+7.5%) and Lower Hudson Valley (+5.9%) subregions grew at a slightly slower than NYC. Hudson County, New Jersey experienced the fastest rate of population growth (+14.3%) of any county in the region, followed by Ocean County, New Jersey (+10.5%) and Essex County, New Jersey (+10.2%). With the exception of Ocean County, New Jersey, and Orange County, New York (+7.6%), less central parts of the region, which led growth during the second half of the 20th century, are generally not growing today.
