  Since 2010, the region has continued to grow at faster rates in the center of the region, in NYC and areas close to the city. NYC’s population has grown 2.7% since 2010, with the Bronx (+3.4%) and Brooklyn (+3.1%) growing faster, Manhattan growing at 2.7%, and Queens (+2.2%) and Staten Island (+1.6%) growing slower. NYC accounted for 53% of regional population growth since 2010. The Inner New Jersey subregion grew at a slightly faster rate (+2.9%) than NYC and accounted for 34% of regional population growth, with Hudson County, New Jersey experiencing the fastest rate of population growth (+6.6%) of any county in the region. Hudson was followed by Rockland County, New York (+4.5%) and Ocean County, New Jersey (+4.4%). Less central parts of the region, which led growth during the second half of the 20th century, are generally not growing today.
