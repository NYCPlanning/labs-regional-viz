menuTitle: "Total Housing Units"
content: |
  As of 2018, there are 9.14 million housing units in the tri-state region, of which 39% are located in NYC. Brooklyn had the highest number of housing units among counties in the region (1.05 million), followed by Manhattan (886,250), Queens (865,900), and Suffolk County (576,900). Reflecting the historic pattern of development, the highest density housing in the region is located primarily in NYC and other historic downtowns, while post-World War II development tended to produce patterns of single family housing further from the urban core.
