content: |
          Local Services employment (retail, leisure, hospitality, and other local services sectors) grew in nearly every county, representing an increase of 371k jobs and a regional growth of +1.7% per year since 2008. NYC accounted for nearly two-thirds of the region's Local Services employment growth, with Manhattan gaining the most jobs (+116k), followed by Brooklyn (+61k, growing fastest at +5.5% per year) and Queens (+37k, +3.2% per year). Growth of this sector generally occurred in areas that gained population, however, areas like Suffolk County, LI registered retail, leisure and hospitality job gains at a rate that exceeded population change post-Recession, +12% vs. -1% total, respectively. Within the Local Services macro sector, growth outside of NYC was mostly attributable to gains in food services and accommodations, with no significant change in the number of retail jobs. NYC was the only subregion to significantly gain retail jobs, adding 49k retail jobs since 2008, with the largest share of retail growth experienced in Brooklyn (+20k jobs), followed by Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx, and Hudson County, NJ. Retail in those areas grew more than 5 times the rate of the national average.
