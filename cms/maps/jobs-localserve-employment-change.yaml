content: |
          Retail, leisure and hospitality employment grew in nearly every county, representing an increase of 317,100 jobs and a regional growth of 18% since 2008. NYC accounted for nearly two-thirds of the region's local services jobs gain, with Manhattan gaining the most (+101,415), followed by Brooklyn (+54,360) and Queens (+31,525). Growth of this sector generally occurred in areas that gained population, however, areas like Suffolk County, LI registered retail, leisure and hospitality job gains at a rate that exceeded population change, +12% vs. -1%, respectively. Within local services, growth outside of NYC was mostly attributable to gains in food services and accommodations, with minor losses or gains of retail jobs. NYC was the only subregion to significantly gain retail jobs, adding 48,600 retail jobs since 2008 while the rest of the region in total lost approximately 2,100 retail jobs.
