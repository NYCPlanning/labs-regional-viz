content: |
          Retail, leisure and hospitality employment grew in nearly every county, representing an increase of 271,408 jobs and a regional growth of 15% since 2008. NYC accounted for about two-thirds of the region's local services jobs gain, with Manhattan gaining the most (+89,509), followed by Brooklyn (+43,851) and Queens (+27,028). Growth of this sector generally occurred in areas that gained population, however, areas like Suffolk County, LI registered retail, leisure and hospitality job gains at a rate that exceed population change, +10.4% vs. -0.1%, respectively. Though retail, leisure and hospitality jobs generally accounted for 20%-30% of county employment, growth of these jobs accounted for anywhere between 40% to 70% of job gains in metro region counties.
