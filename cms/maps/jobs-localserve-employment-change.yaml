content: |
          Local services employment (retail, leisure, hospitality, and other services sectors) grew in nearly every county, representing an increase of +377k jobs and a regional growth of +1.6% per year since 2008. NYC accounted for nearly two-thirds of the region's local services employment growth, with Manhattan gaining the most jobs (+121k), followed by Brooklyn (+64k, growing fastest at +5.2% per year) and Queens (+38k, +3.0% per year). Growth of this sector generally occurred in areas that gained population, however, areas like Suffolk County, LI registered a +12.8% increase in retail, leisure and hospitality job gains post-recession, but lost population since 2010. Within the local services macro sector, growth outside of NYC was mostly attributable to gains in food services and accommodations, with minor declines in the number of retail jobs. NYC was the only subregion to significantly gain retail jobs, adding +48k retail jobs since 2008, with the largest share of retail growth experienced in Brooklyn (+19k jobs), followed by Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx, and Hudson County, NJ. Retail in those areas ranged in growth from five to 20 times greater than the rate of the national average (+0.2% per year).
