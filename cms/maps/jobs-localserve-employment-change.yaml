    Between 2010 and 2019, local services employment (retail, leisure, hospitality, and other services sectors) grew in nearly every county, representing an increase of 402k jobs. NYC accounted for nearly two-thirds of the region's local services employment growth, with Manhattan gaining the most jobs (+120k). Within the local services macro sector, growth outside of NYC was mostly attributable to gains in food services and accommodations, with minor declines in the number of retail jobs. NYC was the only subregion to significantly gain retail jobs, adding 45k retail jobs since 2010.

    The local services sector saw steep declines because of pandemic-related shutdowns of many retail, leisure, and hospitality businesses. Between 2019 and 2020, the NYC Metro saw a decline of 567k local services jobs. Manhattan was especially hard-hit, registering a decline of nearly 199k local services jobs between 2019 and 2020.

    From 2020 to 2021, the region’s local services regained 153k jobs. This came mostly from leisure and hospitality services (+96k), but also from a sizeable rebound in retail jobs (+29k). Manhattan, on the other hand, has only regained about 5k local services jobs, held back by a 5k loss in retail employment over the last year. Some experts attribute this to a lack of activity in central business districts due to a high percentage of [telework-capable](https://dcp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/fa7934157342468c92ffec2f2cdeb253) jobs in the office sector, as well as a slower rebound in tourism.
