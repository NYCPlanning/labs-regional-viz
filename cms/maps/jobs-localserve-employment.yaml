  The region's approximately 2.57 million private sector local services jobs - retail, leisure, food services, accommodations, and other services (e.g., laundromats and auto repair shops) sectors - represent 28% of the region's total private sector employment, the second-largest share behind the office macro sector. Local services private sector employment generated $100 billion in employee wages in 2019, averaging a lower wage per job than the other three macro sectors. 39% of the region's local services jobs are in NYC, (999k), which represent 48% of private sector wages ($48 billion). Local services employment exists throughout the region, with the highest concentrations in densely populated areas or at regional malls.
