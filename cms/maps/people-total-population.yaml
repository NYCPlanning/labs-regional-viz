menuTitle: "Total Population"
content: |
  Today’s tri-state region is home to 23.2 million residents, the largest metro in the United States. New York City’s 8.5 million residents in 2021 represented 37% of the metro region’s population. The next largest city in our region is Newark, which has a population of 312k. There are nearly 900 villages, towns, and cities in our region, many of which are much smaller in population than the dense center of the region. In fact, excluding NYC, the average municipality in the region has 4.2k residents.
