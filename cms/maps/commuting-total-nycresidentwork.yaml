content: |
  As of 2019, there were 4 million employed New Yorkers who commuted to work in the city and the region. 60% of employed NYC residents worked within their home borough, including Manhattan residents who worked in Manhattan. 37% of Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island resident workers commuted to work in Manhattan. 6% of employed New Yorkers out-commuted to work elsewhere in the NYC Metro Region, representing 254k NYC residents. This map illustrates the workplace location for all NYC residents (or the destination of their commute), and the color indicates their borough of residence (or the origin NYC residents' commutes).

  The Bronx and Queens, which share extensive land boundaries with Westchester and Nassau counties, had the highest shares of resident out-commuters in 2019. 10% of employed Queens residents and 9% of employed Bronx residents out-commuted. Brooklyn, with the least direct connection to the region, had the lowest share of out-commuters, just 3% of employed residents.

  NYCâ€™s 254k out-commuters are important contributors to the workforce in surrounding counties. Nassau, Westchester, and Hudson counties, which had the three largest NYC in-commuter workforces in 2019, also employed the largest numbers of NYC residents. NYC residents represented lower percentage shares of the workforce in counties like Suffolk, Bergen, and Essex but still sizeable numbers of total workers (40k combined).
