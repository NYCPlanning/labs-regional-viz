  Shifts in the region’s economic and population growth are reflected in the Housing/Jobs indicator for 2016. Inner NJ counties like Essex and Union, which experienced significant population growth and housing development but lost employment, switched from skewing jobs-intensive (green) in 2000 to housing-intensive (orange) in 2016. On the other hand, Suffolk County, which experienced limited housing/population growth but gained some jobs, shifted from housing-intensive (orange) toward greater balance between housing-jobs (yellow).

  All four NYC boroughs other than Manhattan shifted more jobs-intensive, lowering the ratio of housing units to total employment in a period when the city experienced widespread growth. This is especially true of the Bronx and Brooklyn, which were the only two counties in region with more than two homes/job in 2000 (the most housing-intensive). The Bronx shifted from 2.3 homes/job in 2000 to 1.74 homes/job in 2016, and Brooklyn shifted from 2.1 homes per job in 2000 to 1.49 homes/job in 2016. This reflects the significant job gains in NYC boroughs outside of Manahttan, and implies improved access to employment opportunities for city residents without the need to commute to Manhattan. In contrast, shifts in the region towards more housing-intensive – most notably in New Jersey – imply increasing reliance on commutation into NYC for employment, which increases pressure on regional transit infrastructure.
