  One tool for considering the geographic balance of residents and workplaces in a region is to measure the relative supply of housing and jobs – or the ratio of total housing units to total employment – for a given area. A <b>“Housing/Jobs”</b> indicator helps us understand and evaluate jobs access, or how effectively the resident labor force can access employment. In our region, there was an overall average of 0.85 housing units per job in 2019 (in other words, on average, more than one worker lived in each household). Places in our region that have a housing-to-jobs ratio far lower than 0.85 are often important centers of economic activity (<b>“jobs-intensive”</b>), while areas with a higher housing-to-jobs ratio skewed toward residential (<b>“housing-intensive”</b>) uses. In this map, “jobs-intensive” counties or subregions are indicated in blue, and “housing-intensive” geographies are indicated in orange.

  <b>It is not intrinsically good or bad for an area to be “jobs-intensive” or “housing-intensive.” However, the relationships between these areas have implications for our shared transit infrastructure, the fiscal condition of communities, and other aspects of how we live.</b>

  Shifts in the region’s economic and population growth are reflected in the Housing/Jobs indicator for 2019. Counties within the Inner New Jersey subregion (e.g., Essex) that experienced significant population growth and housing development but lost employment, switched from skewing jobs-intensive (blue) in 2000 to more housing-intensive (orange) in 2019. On the other hand, Suffolk County, which experienced limited housing/population growth but gained some jobs, shifted from housing-intensive (orange) toward greater balance between housing-jobs (yellow).

  All four NYC boroughs other than Manhattan shifted more jobs-intensive, lowering the ratio of housing units to total employment in a period when NYC experienced widespread growth*. This is especially true of the Bronx and Brooklyn, which were the only two counties in region with more than two homes per job in 2000 (the most housing-intensive). The Bronx shifted from 2.3 homes per job in 2000 to 1.66 homes per job in 2019*, and Brooklyn shifted from 2.1 homes per job in 2000 to 1.34 homes per job in 2019. This reflects the significant job gains in NYC boroughs outside of Manhattan, and implies improved access to employment opportunities for NYC residents without the need to commute to Manhattan. In contrast, shifts in the region towards more housing-intensive – most notably in Inner New Jersey – imply increasing reliance on commutation into NYC for employment, which increases pressure on regional transit infrastructure.

  Sources & Notes: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) NAICS-Based Data Files, Annual Average 2019; U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (PEP) 2019. *NYC public sector employment (e.g., teachers, police) was not allocated to actual borough of workplace employment in 2000 and had been registered to headquarters locations. Appropriate allocation of jobs to place-of-work in 2019 accounts for slight additional shifts towards more jobs intensive ratios for non-Manhattan boroughs in 2019.
