menuTitle: "Primary Mode of Travel to Work in Non-Manhattan Boroughs"
content: |
  40% of NYC residents working in Non-Manhattan Boroughs use transit to commute to work (734,000), which is a lower share than Manhattanâ€™s transit commuters, but twice the rate of regional in-commuters who use transit. Only 24% of in-commuters to Non-Manhattan Boroughs are commuting by rail, subway/PATH, bus, or ferry transit.

  Though the highest share of NYC residents commuting to Non-Manhattan Borough jobs by transit use subway, the bus network enables city residents to commute to many Non-Manhattan Borough jobs in areas not serviced by subways. Though bus is not as prominent for supporting regional in-commuters' jobs access, a few bus markets exist where Nassau Inter-County Express (NICE) bus serves portions of Queens, or where Bee-Line bus serves the Bronx.

  309,000 regional in-commuters work in Non-Manhattan boroughs, representing 17% of the non-Manhattan NYC workforce. Despite the presence of regional rail and residents' ability to access NYC business districts outside Manhattan (e.g., Jamaica, Downtown Brooklyn), commuter rail represents a small portion of the in-commuters' primary mode choice. Today, 75% of in-commuters are driving, the largest number of which are from Long Island (123,000). Sizeable driving populations also commute from other subregions. 73,000 regional in-commuters travel by transit to non-Manhattan workplaces. Inner New Jersey is home to the greatest number of Non-Manhattan Borough workers commuting by rail, bus, and subway/PATH transit. Since most transit services from New Jersey terminate in Manhattan, it is likely that transit in-commuters are also using the NYC subway for a portion of their trip to access Non-Manhattan Borough jobs. Long Island also had 23,000 regional rail, bus and subway in-commuters, primarily accessing jobs in Queens or Downtown Brooklyn. The Lower Hudson Valley is also home to in-commuters accessing jobs in Bronx by transit.

Dots represent the residence location of people working in Non-Manhattan Boroughs (i.e. Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island combined), age 16 and older, or the origin of Non-Manhattan NYC workers' commutes. Color indicates the primary mode of travel used for the longest leg of commuters' trips to work.
