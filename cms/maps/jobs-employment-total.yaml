menuTitle: "Total Employment"
content: |
  n 2020, our region employed 9.7 million, representing 7% of total U.S. jobs, and generated $848 billion in annual worker wages, representing 10% of total U.S. wages.

  The location of jobs within the region roughly mirrors population distribution, with the densest concentrations of employment in NYC (particularly in Manhattan), but also significant levels of employment spread throughout the tri-state area.

  NYC accounted for 41% of the metro region’s jobs (4.0 million) and half of the region’s annual worker wages ($425 billion). Manhattan alone represented 2.2 million jobs (23% of regional employment) and $320 billion in annual worker wages (38% of regional wages) – the highest for any county in the nation. Outside of NYC, there are 5.71 million jobs providing employment for regional residents, including 254k NYC residents who commute out of the city for work.
