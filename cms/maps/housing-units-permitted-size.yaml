content: |
  Nearly 508k new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2019 – more than of the total housing stock of the City of San Francisco in a nine-year period. NYC accounted for 43% of new housing (220k units) and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 30% (154k units). Housing development in Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley subregions combined accounted for just 17% of new permitted units.

  Approximately three-quarters of the total permitted units were in multifamily buildings, 71% in buildings with five or more units (361k), and 5% in buildings with two-to-four units (27k). 120k permits were issued for buildings with one unit, characteristic of low-density suburbs.

  Today the region has 3.3 million households in buildings with five or more units, of which NYC accounts for 66% (2.2 million units) and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounts for 16% (533k units). Areas in New Jersey proximate to NYC, especially those well connected by regional rail transit, are adding significant amounts of multifamily housing. Since 2010, NYC accounted for 56% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with five or more units (202k units), slightly lower than its regional share, and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 30% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with three or more units (107k units), twice its regional share of units in such buildings. These areas coincide with those that are also experiencing considerable population and younger labor force growth.
