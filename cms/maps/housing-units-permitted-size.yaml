content: |
  Nearly 325,000 new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2016 – the equivalent of the total housing stock of Seattle being added in a six-year period. NYC accounted for 44% of new housing (142,000 units) and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 29% (95,000 units). Housing development in Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley subregions combined accounted for just 17% of new permitted units. Nearly three-quarters of the total permitted units were in buildings that have three or more units (235,000 units), with only 90,000 units permitted in buildings with one or two units, which are characteristic of lower-density areas.

  Today the region has 3.8 million households in buildings with three or more units, of which NYC accounts for 63% (2.4 million units) and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounts for 17% (667,000 units). Areas in New Jersey proximate to NYC, especially those well connected by regional rail transit, are adding significant amounts of multifamily housing. Since 2010, NYC accounted for 57% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with three or more units (133,000 units), slightly lower than its regional share, and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 28% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with three or more units (66,000 units), higher than its regional share of units in such buildings. These areas coincide with those that are also experiencing considerable population and prime-age labor force growth.
