content: |
  Nearly 438,000 new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2018 – more than of the total housing stock of the City of San Francisco in an eight-year period. NYC accounted for 44% of new housing (191,000 units) and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 30% (130,000 units). Housing development in Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley subregions combined accounted for just 17% of new permitted units. Nearly three-quarters of the total permitted units were in multifamily buildings, 70% in buildings with five or more units (308,000), and 5% in buildings with two-to-four units (23,000). 106,000 permits were issued for buildings with one unit, characteristic of low-density suburbs.

  Today the region has 3.2 million households in buildings with five or more units, of which NYC accounts for 67% (2.2 million units) and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounts for 15% (490,000 units). Areas in New Jersey proximate to NYC, especially those well connected by regional rail transit, are adding significant amounts of multifamily housing. Since 2010, NYC accounted for 57% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with five or more units (174,500 units), slightly lower than its regional share, and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 29% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with three or more units (90,000 units), twice its regional share of units in such buildings. These areas coincide with those that are also experiencing considerable population and younger labor force growth.
