menuTitle: "Housing Production by Building Size, 2010 to 2021"
content: |
  More than 635k new housing units were issued permits in the region from 2010 to 2021 – about the size of the total housing stock of New Hampshire. NYC accounted for 41% of new housing (261k units) and the Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 32% (201k units). Housing development in Long Island, Southwest Connecticut and the Hudson Valley subregions combined accounted for just 18% of new permitted units.
  Approximately three-quarters of the total permitted units were in multifamily buildings, 71% in buildings with five or more units (452k), and 5% in buildings with two-to-four units (32k). 150k permits were issued for buildings with one unit, characteristic of low-density suburbs.
  While NYC is historically the region’s driver of multifamily housing development, adjacent areas in New Jersey, especially those near regional rail transit, have permitted significant amounts of multifamily housing since 2010 as well. Since 2010, the Inner New Jersey subregion accounted for 31% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with five or more units (142k units), twice its all-time regional share of units in such buildings. NYC still accounted for 53% of the region’s permitted units in buildings with five or more units (241k units), but this is slightly lower than its all-time regional share.

For municipalities, housing permit data reflect U.S. Census Bureau building permitting geographies, a different boundary than the municipality boundary represented in other maps. For NYC sub-borough area on the municipality layer, data were only available through 2020. 2021 data were not available below the county (i.e., borough) level at the time of this update. Dot density maps are illustrative only, please see [Data Reliability](/about/#data-reliability) for additional notes on geographic accuracy and precision, and [About](/about/#housing) for more information about housing permits and the housing permit geography.
